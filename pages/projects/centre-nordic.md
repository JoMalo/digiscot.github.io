## Project plan

### Project description

CNS will work with elderly members of the Orkney and Shetland Community to teach them how to use digital technology through the use of the app Fieldtrip GB. People will be able to capture minor place-names and stories attached to specific places in the landscape. The data captured will be uploaded to a website, which will form a lasting legacy and which will also continuously be used to add more data. Participants will also be trained in scanning photographs and uploading other types of material to the project website.


## Project milestones
Orkney

Milestone 1: Purchase of smart phones and printer/scanner. Advertise the workshop in The Orcadian. Match funding for staff time: Initial meeting with the Orkney Heritage Society on 22 April. Appearance on BBC Radio Orkney, press release for the Orcadian. Contact other local heritage societies and small museums.  Set up ‘skeleton’ website.  Develop questionnaire for EDINA app and test new smart phones.	Marketing using posters to promote our project to the local community in order to spread information about the project and our activities and will gain participants for our workshop and field days. This is all to ensure we are ready to start working on the project by the envisaged start date of May 25. Expected completion date: 4/6/15

Milestone 2: Workshop held in late May/early June. Community work with participants for Alex Sanmark and Ragnhild Ljosland with data capturing and uploading material to the website. Participants will also be given help with scanning and other digital tasks relating to the project. This is the overall aim of the project and will teach participants to use digital technology. We will also gain ‘community agents’ during this time, who can spread the project further. Expected completion date: 30/9/15

Milestone 3: Mid-way review. CNS will assess the progress of the project at its half-way point, report back to SCVO, and ensure that the project webpage has been kept up to date with project developments. Expected completion date:  July 31st

Milestone 4: Additional work on the website. Collecting and presentation of data captured by community agents and new project participants. Match funding: staff time, IT help and use of CNS accommodation. This work will make sure that the website contains all data captured so far and will give training to new participants or existing ones still in need of help. Expected completion date: 30/9/15

Shetland

Milestone 1: Hold initial meeting with Chair of Shetland Heritage Association and discuss project 18th May.  Show her how to use Fieldtrip GB. Send out leaflets to all members of association including local museums and history clubs. Purchase 6 x Hudl2 by 5th June.  Match funding for staff time. Advertise the workshop of 5th June being held at Shetland College on 29th May in The Shetland Times. Give appearance on BBC Radio Shetland and press release for the Shetland Times. Work with Orkney CNS to set up ‘skeleton’ website and develop online map. Develop Shetland version of questionnaire for Fieldtrip GB app and test Hudls. Carry out marketing using posters to promote the project to the local community in order to spread information about the project and our activities and to gain participants for our workshop and field days. The posters will be distributed throughout the learning centres in Shetland. This is will ensure the project will be ready to start of envisaged start date of June 5th. Expected completion date: 4/6/15

Milestone 2: Workshop held on 5th June by Andrew Jennings. Intensive community work in the islands by Andrew Jennings sharing knowledge with elderly participants and showing them how to capture data and upload the material to the website. Participants will also be given help with other digital tasks relating to the project. The overall aim of the project is to teach participants how to use digital technology. The Chair of Shetland Heritage Association will help us gain ‘community agents’ during this time, who will spread the project further, particularly to the outlying areas such as Fair Isle, the north Isles of Unst and Yell, and further to Skerries. Expected completion date: 30/9/15

Milestone 3: Mid-way review. CNS will assess the progress of the project at its half-way point, report back to SCVO, and ensure that the project webpage has been kept up to date with project developments. Expected completion date:  July 31st

Milestone 4: Additional work on the website, including developing the map of Orkney and Shetland. Collecting and presentation of data captured by community agents and new project participants from throughout Shetland. Match funding: staff time, IT help and use of CNS accommodation in Shetland College. This work will make sure that the website contains all data captured so far and will give training to new participants or existing ones still in need of help. Expected completion date: 30/9/15

**Achievements:**

On April 18 Ragnhild Ljosland and Alex Sanmark gave a presentation to the Orkney Heritage Society. The members were delighted and were keen to be involved. A new meeting has been scheduled.

Our Orkney press release is out! Date of the first workshop set to June 6. [See it here](http://www.orkney.uhi.ac.uk/news/orkney-community-digital-heritage-project) We were also interviewed by BBC Radio Orkney about the project and our forthcoming workshop.

During  early May Andrew met Pat Christie of Shetland Heritage Association and began the process of meeting elderly people in Shetland keen on preserving their heritage. Our Shetland press release is also out! [See it here](http://www.shetland.uhi.ac.uk/news/heritage-to-be-explored-through-smart-technology) Our new Facebook group Shetland Digital Heritage Project is also up and running. Andrew was interviewed by BBC Radio Shetland on 04/06.
The date of the workshop is also set for June 6. We are going to connect Orkney and Shetland with VC.

Porject update June 17: Milestone 1 has been completed and we are now working towards Milestone 2. The following activities have taken place:

Update from Orkney. Milestone 1 has been completed and we are now working towards Milestone 2. The following activities have taken place:

19th May:
Ragnhild Ljosland held a workshop with the Orkney branch of the University of the Third Age (U3A) at the Orkney Library in Kirkwall. This was our first workshop with a group of complete beginners in the sense that most had never used a tablet before, although a handful had prior experience. We discovered the need to go right back to basics, such as how do you switch the tablet on, and the fact that the picture turns when you turn the device. After the workshop, we completely re-wrote the information sheet, to include screetshots with arrows and detailed explanations. We now have two versions: One for the more experienced and one for the complete beginners. Another lesson learned was about group size and mixed ability groups. The U3A group was large: 45 people participated. It was difficult to help everybody at once, especially because they were at very different stages. Having learnt this lesson, we developed a step-by-step approach for the next workshop, in Sanday, where we went through the absolute basics first and then got onto the more advanced option of downloading the app to your own device last once everything else was done. The U3A group did enjoy the workshop, though, and some took Hudls away on loan.

Orkney 3rd June:
Ragnhild Ljosland spent the day in the island of Sanday, where she met with the local Afternoon Club. This is a club for retired people which meets on a Wednesday afternoon in the Sanday Community Centre and invites speakers and activities. The Orkney Community Digital Heritage project made contact and was invited to the Afternoon Club to speak about the project and hold a workshop. 15 Afternoon Club members attended. They were informed about the project aims, and were shown some of the records which have already been uploaded to the collection. They all thought it was a good idea for a project, and some had ideas for sites in Sanday which could be included. In the workshop, they all got to try a Hudl tablet, and some of them found it enjoyable while others found it difficult. A couple had previous experience using a tablet, but most were beginners. We recorded the Sanday Community Centre together and spoke about how they could then make more records themselves at the places in the island where they have memories to share.

Lesson learned: Some of the oldest people felt they were 'too old' to learn anything new and also that their information wasn’t 'valuable'. There is a big threshold from showing them as a group, and getting them to try it there and then, to actually going out and recording things themselves. They seemed interested while we were trying it in the community centre, but then at the end when I asked who would like to take a Hudl home to have a go themselves then nobody took one. (However, two people had their own iPads and they said they would collect information on them). The lesson is that for very old people, you need a person to accompany them out in the field while they make the records. Simply showing them how to do it is not enough. You can see a picture of the event here

Orkney and Shetland 6th June: Workshops held at the same time at Orkney and Shetland Colleges. Both workshops had been advertised in the local papers and BBC Radio Orkney and Shetland, as well as the local Heritage associations. In Orkney a number of people turned up, who all had their own tablets and smart phones. They were very inspired by the project and felt that they had information that they wanted to record. One participant in particular was keen to teach other older community members how to use the app. She had one or two particular people in mind. At the beginning of the workshop we connected the two colleges via a VC link so that the participants could say hello to each other.

The Shetland workshop, although  small in numbers was still a success, as one of the people who attended was from Fair Isle and is very involved with heritage and tourism on the island. She was very interested in the software. She tried one of the Hudls and also got me to help her download the app on to her phone. She will go back to Fair Isle, show off the app and discuss the project with people there. Andrew has been invited to go to Fair Isle in July or early September to meet older people there and encourage them to use the software and start collecting stories. There is now some competition developing between the outlying areas of Shetland about who is going to use the app most!

Orkney 12th June:
Two members of the public visited Centre for Nordic Studies. They had missed the workshop on 6th June and came in to learn how to take part in the project. We guided them through how to use Fieldtrip on a tablet. They intended to involve their parents in the project.

Lesson learned: These were people in their 60s who were experienced users of digital technology. They picked up in a few minutes what it took 90 minutes for the Sanday Afternoon Club members to learn. They will aid the project by accompanying their parents out to record things.

Orkney 16th June:
Ragnhild Ljosland spent an hour and a half with a project participant: a 64-year-old who had never used a tablet before. The participant has grown up in Kirkwall and the time was spent walking around the centre of Kirkwall making records of memories and stories from the 1950s and 60s.

Lesson learned: This participant had never used a tablet before, but found the project very enjoyable and reasonably easy, although she did have some trouble at first finding the right technique to touch the screen – not to short and not too long. We got a lot of recording done and the participant was getting the hang of using the tablet by the end. It shows that accompanying participants out in the field, one-to-one, is a worthwhile thing to do. This is an image taken by the participant using the app.

Shetland 18th May:
Andrew Jennings met Pat Christie the chairperson of the Shetland Heritage Association to show her how to use Fieldtrip GB. Pat is also the secretary of Cunningsburgh History Group, which is very popular with the older folk in Cunningsburgh. She was intrigued by the app and Andrew showed her how to do download it on to her iPhone. She was very keen to get the older people at the Cunningsburgh History Group involved as they have lots of stories to tell. She was also very keen to set up a trip to Skerries, one of the UK’s most isolated communities, where there are a number of older people who would love to learn how to use modern technology to preserve their heritage for the future. Pat found the app easy to use, which cheered her mightily. She has managed to organise a visit to Skerries and has informed everyone there to be ready. The trip will take place on the 18th of June, weather permitting.

Lesson learned: Pat was wary of the technology at first. She usually gets her family to set things up for her. However she was excited by the result and could quickly see the possible uses. She was recruited as a supporter of the project and went off to the Cunningsburgh History Group to encourage them to invite Andrew to attend their next meeting. It is a good idea to encourage a local person to tell others. They are likely to believe the project has merit and the technology is easy to use if one of their peers is a supporter.

Lesson learned: Advertising widely does not necessarily encourage large numbers to turn up. However, if the right person does turn up then the project can be taken directly into the outlying communities. Finding the right vector is important.

16th June:
Andrew Jennings visited the island of Whalsay to meet older people learning about genealogy at the Learning Centre in Symbister House, the local school. The meeting was organised by the local tutor. The participants were keen to practice with the Hudls and to go outside and take photographs. Whalsay has a very active local history association and the chair was present. She was very excited about the prospect of collecting stories about her island. She usually gets her grandson to set up her phone and computer and so was a little tentative at first, but quickly got the hang of the software and had it downloaded on to her phone. She is going to practice with the software and tell other people in the history association. Andrew will return to Whalsay soon to show them how to use the equipment.

Lesson learned: If people are convinced of the benefit of the technology for themselves, and can see how they can use it do something they want, they are keen to use it.

19/6/15:
Kim Foden returned and invited Ragnhild out for a walk around Kirkwall to record more memories of Kirkwall in the 1950 and 60 and how the town has grown. We spent about two hours walking around and making recordings. Kim is now fully capable of using the tablet to make her own recordings, and was doing it herself, but felt it was better to have Ragnhild with her to avoid the awkwardness of speaking to herself.

24/6/15:
Ragnhild Ljosland went out to Dyke End on Scapa Bay to visit Johnnie Meil (age: 91) who had spoken to another participant and was keen to get involved in the project. He had never used a tablet before. Although he preferred Ragnhild to work the technology for him, he did have a go at taking photos and using the voice recorder on the tablet. Johnnie was delighted to share memories and stories from World War 2 in Orkney, and we made 7 recordings regarding various aspects of wartime Orkney. We agreed that Ragnhild would come back another day to do more, as he has lots of stories he wishes to share. Lesson learned: One memory led to another for Johnnie, while Ragnhild was trying to separate them out in different records. We ended up saying “could you wait a minute while I store this bit first” a lot, and we also ended up with several records being made in the same GPS position which will make the dots appear over the top of one another on the map. From the technology’s point of view it is easier to move around to one place at a time, but from the participant’s point of view it feels more natural to speak about lots of different things in a string of associations without having to stop, save, and move.

4-5/7: Ragnhild spent a weekend in Flotta gathering stories and memories. The lesson learned this time was that there are many stories which are deemed unfit to be out in public, as part of this project on a freely available website, because they are controversial or involve trouble such as inheritance and money trouble, or family conflicts of one sort or another, or would bring shame in one way or another to living relatives in the community. But these are often the most exciting stories and interesting portrayals of island life. In Flotta, which had a large camp for soldiers in World War Two, I heard marvellous stories about how the locals managed to make a bit of extra money out of the situation, but these were deemed unfit for the public ear! So although we got a lot recorded, there was just as much again which I was not allowed to record. One of the devices was left behind in Flotta and is going to spend the next few weeks there. Hopefully more people will use it.

9/7/15
Ragnhild spent a lovely evening in Firth with Neil Leask who shared some good stories. I have now at last figured out how to get around the problem that the GPS times out before getting a position.

16/7/15
Andrew's trip to The Skerries had to be postponed until later in August as the weather made a flight impossible. That is one of the problems with involving Scotland's most isolated islands in a project of this type. Sometimes nature is against you! However, in July a different isolated island was reached, the beautiful, little inhabited island of Fetlar. Andrew Jennings visited the island by ferry and spent the day at the Heritage Centre with Frances who was very keen to learn how to use the equipment and to encourage others on the island to use it. She practised taking pictures of the unusual items in the heritage centre, like Jeemsie Laurenson's ditty box. Frances had told many islanders about Andrew's arrival. However, despite being keen to find out more, only a couple of people turned up. Frances decided to borrow one of the Hudls and show it to the community after Andrew had left. She also wanted to put it into practice by interviewing one of the oldest islanders and recording some of her stories

Lesson learned: Frances was very keen to learn how to use the equipment and to encourage others. However, despite her best efforts, most people she contacted were too busy doing other things. To counteract this she decided to borrow the Hudl and show it round the island.

Ragnhild Ljosland spent a weekend in the island of Papa Westray (locally known as Papay) from 28-30 August. This is one of Orkney’s smallest islands, which meant that it was easier to get in contact with people. In advance, we had got in touch with a family that runs an art centre in Papay to arrange our visit. They volunteered to let us have our Digital Heritage workshop in their art centre, and spread the news around Papay that we would be coming. When Ragnhild arrived, she was immediately able to meet with people who were interested in taking part. Throughout the weekend, word spread further about the project and people were helpful with suggestions of names of folk and houses to visit. An open workshop was held on the Friday evening, in which four people took part, one of whom had recently settled in Papay and felt that he did not yet have local stories to share, but was very keen to be one of our “community agents”. He had never used a tablet before, but found it enjoyable and took one home to borrow for a few weeks to try to record other islanders. In addition to the open workshop, Ragnhild found that the best way of involving people in a small island is to be bold and knock on their doors. Taking up stand in the local shop was also a good idea, as was also taking part in the pub night in the community hall. People were very varied. One senior couple were delighted to share stories and we spent the best part of an afternoon recording, sometimes not managing to work the Fieldtrip app fast enough to keep up with the flow of stories. It was handy that we had by now discovered how to move the pinpoint to a different position on the map, which meant that we could sit in the comfort of their home recording information and stories relating to other locations on the island. Some people are more used to being asked than others, and especially this elderly man has a status and local reputation as the one who has lived his whole life on the island and as the one who knows all the stories, which he has used for tour-guiding purposes in the past and also for writing his memoirs. Another person we visited, although also local to the island, does not have such a status and at first felt that he had no stories to share, but as the conversation unfolded it turned out that he did. One thing that was evident was that incomers have stories too, and not just those who are Papay born and bred. Several incomers, who had lived for various lengths of time in the island, were interviewed and had many interesting things to share. In total, 11 people were involved with the project in Papa Westray. Of these, one took on the role as “community agent” and borrowed a Hudl tablet to continue collecting stories there over the next few weeks.

Two pictures and stories collected in Papa Westray:

Andrew headed north on the 26th of August for a two day visit to Scotland’s most northerly islands – Yell and Unst. On the first day he visited several sites on Yell including the Old Haa Heritage Centre at Burravoe. There he met Nita who was lookgin after the place and selling home bakes. Nita was very interested in the Hudls and what they might be able to use them for in Yell. Unfortunately,  although she rang around, no one answered their phone. Nonetheless a good long time was spent showing Nita, and a couple of visitors to the heritage centre, how to use the Hudsl and how to use the IPhone. She was very keen for us to go back and give another demonstration. After leave the Old Haa Andrew headed for the ferry to Unst. At the Heritage Centre and Boat Haven in Haraldswick he had a great session with Rhoda and Minnie. They were  very enthusiastic and keen to learn about the tablets and try the software.

Minnie and Rhoda try the Hudls:

On the 2nd of September Andrew visited Scalloway Museum. There he met Bill, who he’d had an earlier chat about the project while walking dogs on the hill. Bill was very interested in the concept and tried out the Hudls and downloaded the app on to his phone. He had never done that before. He was keen to try out the equipment around Scalloway at a later date.

On the 3rd Andrew headed off to opposite end of Shetland from Unst, Sumburgh the Sooth End. There he met the eight custodians of the Quendale Mill Heritage Centre. This proved to be an excellent session. Some custodians used the Hudls others downloaded the app on their smartphones. There was a good deal of discussion about how Fieldtrip GB could be used to help collect stories, genealogy and map unusual things in the landscape. They suggested Andrew keep in touch and help them organise something in the future.

With Sumburgh and the Haraldswick in Unst having been visited, Andrew has covered nearly the 100 miles of Shetland’s length in two weeks talking to heritage people. What has become obvious is that everyone with an interest in heritage is keen to learn about the equipment and can see the value of it, but folk are reticent to go off and use it. They clearly want return visits. The first visit encourages people to think about the idea, but follow up visits are necessary to help them overcome their fears.

On 18 September Silke Reeploeg of The Centre for Nordic Studies in Shetland held a project workshop at the North Mainland Learning Centre in Brae. Our novice tablet users had an extremely steep learning curve, but coped very well - even if Siri kept wanting to talk to our iPad user, who got a fright and the giggles every time!  After lots of laughter we explored all the many and varied apps on our Android Hudls, and had a first go at downloading the FieldTripGB app.  Participants found the app very easy to use, and went away to practice and gain some more confidence using their own devices.  Hopefully next week we will be able to add some content!

Sunday 20 September: the Shetland team travelled to the north of the Shetland mainland again, to join the 'Gie it a Go' Day in Mossbank.  This community event took place at the neighbouring Mossbank Primary School and Mossbank Hall and offered families and older people the opportunities to try out various activities - from drumming, crafts and sports to adult learning and digital skills.  The aim of the event was to bring together community groups, individuals and education/care providers, raise awareness of learning and social activities, and give people a chance to develop their skills.  We learned that joining existing community events is an ideal way to share our project and interact with a wide range of people, with family members of different ages enjoying the Fieldtrip GB app together.  A wobbly wifi connection and a few technical hitches meant we had to improvise with the app functionality a bit, but participants found both the tablets easy to use, and the maps fascinating and enjoyed looking at what people had added.   And then there was homemade cake from the Mossbank Hall committee, yay!

Silke Reeploeg has also introduced the project to members of the Bressay History Group.  Much fun was had getting to grips with using the tablets, with three novice users and one more experienced tablet user installing the app on her own device.  We managed to document a recent addition to the Bressay Heritage's collection, a traditional wooden 'mail boat' called the "Bressay Lass".  We learned that new users were easily introduced to the app, but would actually like more time to experiment with the tablet. Participants asked if they could borrow the Hudls in future, and perhaps create their own maps. There is definitely interest in developing the use of tablets to collect more information in future projects.

Our website is up and running! This is where we have collected all the records captured by our lovely project participants. The page still needs some tweaking and there are also some records still to be uploaded. But as a work in progress, we are very pleased. See it [here](http://digital.norseworld.com/)


## Evaluation

The project will be continuously evaluated. Participants will complete a questionnaire at the start and end of the project. 10% of the participants will also be interviewed. In this way CNS will establish the success of the project from the start. The amount of data captured and uploaded will also be continuously monitored.


## Outputs and outcomes
Overall this project has been a great success and we are delighted with the outcomes. We have all very much enjoyed working with the different community groups and are keen to continue with this work in the future.

From the very start of the project, we made great efforts to maximise the impact of the project and gain interest from elderly people in the local community. We therefore sent in press releases and advertised in the local papers (The Orcadian and Shetland Times) and were interviewed by BBC Radio Orkney and BBC Radio Shetland. We also designed an information leaflet and a PowerPoint presentation, which we used at our different meetings.
In terms of outputs we delivered a number of workshops aimed at elderly people in Orkney and Shetland. We managed to cover a large number of different islands and places, which can be summarised as follows:



Orkney:

•	Presentation to the Orkney Heritage Society in Kirkwall.

•	Meeting with elderly people on the island of North Ronaldsay.

•	Workshop held at Orkney College in Kirkwall.

•	Workshop with the Orkney branch of the University of the Third Age (U3A) at the Orkney Library in Kirkwall.

•	Workshop with the Afternoon Club on the island of Sanday.

•	One to one session with an elderly person in Kirkwall. This was repeated a second time.

•	Session with two members of the public who came the Centre for Nordic Studies to learn about the project.

•	One to one session with a 91-year old at Dyke End on Scapa Bay, Orkney Mainland.

•	Weekend in the island of Flotta gathering stories and memories from elderly people on the community.

•	Data gathering in Firth, Orkney Mainland.

•	Weekend in the island of Papa Westray.



Shetland:

•	Meeting with the chairperson of the Shetland Heritage Association, Shetland Mainland.

•	Workshop with elderly people learning about genealogy at the Learning Centre in Symbister House on the island of   Whalsay.

•	Workshop held at Shetland College in Lerwick.

•	Workshop the Heritage Centre on the island of Fetlar.

•	Workshop at the Old Haa Heritage Centre at Burravoe on the island of Yell.

•	Workshop at the Heritage Centre and Boat Haven in Haraldswick on the island of Unst.

•	Visit to the Scalloway Museum on the Shetland Mainland.

•	Workshop with the eight custodians of the Quendale Mill Heritage Centre, Sumburgh on the Shetland Mainland.

•	Workshop at the North Mainland Learning Centre in Brae on the Shetland Mainland.

•	‘Gie it a Go’ Day in Mossbank, Shetland Mainland.

•	Workshop with the Bressay History Group, the island of Bressay.


At every meeting we asked participants to fill out our questionnaire in order to establish their level of knowledge and experience of digital technology and smart phones/tablets before taking part in the project. In-depth interviews were also carried out with select groups, after the project had been completed. This allowed us to collect a great deal of information about the success of the project and what should be done differently in the future.

The following questions were asked in our initial questionnaire:

•	Did you have experience with using a ‘tablet’ (hand-held computer) before? (Had never used one before / Have had a go, but not a lot of experience / I have prior experience using a tablet)

•	Do you think that trying a ‘tablet’ for the Digital Heritage project would inspire you to use a “tablet” again for other things if you get the chance in the future?

•	What feedback would you give the Centre for Nordic Studies about the Digital Heritage project?

A website (based on Drupal) has been set up for the purposes of the project [(see it here)](http://digital.norseworld.com/), to which all the data captured by our project participants will be uploaded. To date, most records have been added to the site, but due to technical problems, some remain to be added. Another problem encountered has been the loss of information when the information is sent from the device to the website. Most of these errors have now been rectified, but we are still in the process of checking all the individual records. The project funding has paid for this site to be maintained for the next 10 years, which will enable us to continue using the website for further work on the Digital Heritage project. We can also use it later and extend it for other, similar, community projects.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has certainly achieved its aims. We have reached a large number of elderly people with no or little knowledge of digital technology and taught them how to use tablets and/or smart phones. At the same time we also gathered a lot of information about Orkney and Shetland, data which is now available on our website.

From our close work with these community members, the completed questionnaires and our in-depth interviews we know that people enjoyed taking part, have overcome their apprehension of smart phones, tablets and digital technology, and feel ready to try again. Many people did actually have smart phones and tablets and through our workshops we showed them what additional uses these devices have. In particular, many people were delighted when discovering the GPS function, and commented that this was a feature they were likely to use again, independent of the Fieldtrip GB app.
It is clear that the large majority of the project participants were new to this type of technology. In fact, only 20% of participants ticked the box saying that they had ‘prior experience using a tablet’, while 26% said that they had ‘had a go, but not a lot of experience’, which means that over half (54%) had never used a table before. Overall, the project participants found the workshops inspiring and useful. In reply to the second question on our questionnaire, only 6.7% replied that they did not feel inspired to using a tablet or smart phone again, while 15% said that they would most likely try again. The remainder of the participants were all very keen to continue using digital technology.

In terms of general feedback on the project (Question 3), people were enthusiastic, with comments such as ‘Fascinating project!’, ‘This seems an easy way to record history’ and ’worthwhile project’. One participant said: ‘I was a bit afraid of the tablet, but once I had been given friendly instruction I would be happy to do more on my own’. An added benefit was the recording function of the app, which was commented on by a Shetland participant, who enjoyed being able to record history in their own dialect, which of course is much more difficult in writing. Another participant said: ‘Being able to relate to a specific subject makes this use of a tablet real’.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. Organising workshops via already existing local groups, such as the University of the 3rd Age and Sanday Afternoon Club. Since these groups were already meeting regularly we were able to join their meetings to present the project. This worked better than the open workshops we held in Kirkwall, Papa Westray and Lerwick where people had to use their own initiative to come. Coming along independently can be difficult for older people and the open workshops were not as well attended as we had hoped. So contact with existing community groups targeted at older people was definitely a good idea. Also, attending community events such as the ‘Gie it a Go’ day in Shetland worked really well, as both the target group (older people) and family members could participate within an informal setting. In this way, family members could encourage and help their elderly relatives to overcome their initial resistance to using digital technology.

2. The one-to-one sessions worked well once the initial hurdle of making contact and setting up a date, time and meeting place was overcome. Assisting the participants in using the Hudl tablet on a one-to-one basis felt more comfortable for the participants and we gathered more material this way.

3. The island visits, such as the visit to Papa Westray where we did ‘snowball recruiting’ in the community were also very successful. We started with people we already knew, who introduced us to their neighbours, who in turn had further tips on people to contact. Also being bold and knocking on doors and contacting people while at the island shop and pub worked well.

4. The choice of app (Fieldtrip GB) was commented on positively by many participants, who thought that was a really good use of tablet technology and expanded their knowledge of what you could do with IT and the internet. Overall the app was much admired and the users could really see how this would impact on their research making it easier to do. There was definite interest from those wanting to collect stories from older members of the community.

Things that we would do differently next time:

1. The ‘community agent’ approach didn’t work very well. These were meant to be dedicated participants who would help older people in their acquaintance use the technology, and for example drive them to places they have memories about. We found it difficult to recruit people who had enough determination to actually go out and do these things without us being there with them. We had some people from the Orkney Heritage Society, and other community members, who expressed great enthusiasm and who were trained by us in using the technology and borrowed Hudls, but then failed to do any data gathering with new participants.

2. Leaving Hudls with members of the island communities did not gather as much material as we had hoped. We found that people enjoyed sharing memories and stories while we were there to assist them, but the leap required to do it on their own (even with the detailed visual instruction booklet and us a phone call away) was too great for most participants. In a future project we would arrange a series of visits to the same group in order to help people learn to master the technology and gather even more data.  We found that participants often needed more than one session to simply learn how to use the tablet and all its features, before getting to grips with the app itself.

3. The project period was too short. Ideally we would have wanted to run it until Christmas, but this was not possible due funding regulations. When we were planning the project, we thought summer would be the best time for data gathering in terms of weather, but we in actual fact it would have been better to run this later in the year as many people, especially farmers, tend to be very busy during the summer. This summer was particularly difficult due to the rainy weather, which meant that the farming season ran for longer than usual. We were in contact with additional community groups and organisations, such as the Westray Heritage Centre (on the island of Westray), the Shapinsay ranger (on the island of Shapinsay), the Friends of St Ninian’s in Deerness (Orkney mainland) and the Stromness museum (Orkney mainland), all of which expressed interest in the project and wanted us to do workshops with them, but were unable to find a time at this time of year that would suit them. In addition, many people have been in touch wanting to learn how to use the equipment recently. People clearly take a long time to think about using new technology and it needs multiple adverts, phone calls and interviews for them to make the decision to get involved. Long lead in times are needed.
