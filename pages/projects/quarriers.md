### Project description

Quarriers ( through its Go4It project, an award winning project which helps people we support develop digital skills), partnering with the Glasgow Centre for Independent Living ( a disabled led organisation), wish to use the opportunity given by the Digital Challenge Fund to undertake a piece of Action Research on digital exclusion. We aim to find out underlying stories about why people have been digitally excluded or chosen not to use computers, and the impact of then being digitally included.

Our “Stories from the Digital Divide” project will work intensively with twelve people with learning disabilities living in Glasgow and the surrounding area. This is a group known to face above average rates of digital exclusion. Within that group we would expect to have people who are older and who are seeking social security allowances. By spending time getting to know them, and working closely with them to develop their basic digital skills (by delivering Quarriers DigiKnow basic IT skills course) over a three month period, the project will be able to produce a piece of grounded action research, rich in qualitative data that seeks to find out more about why people have been digitally excluded and what sort of actions lead to them moving beyond exclusion into participation.

The project will work with twelve individuals to fully document their story around digital exclusion - mapping their story, describing their learning journey on the project and explaining the outcome of their experience. Data on the participants will be collected throughout their time on the project by project staff through semi structured interviews, informal conversations, questionnaires and observations. Data will be collected on an individual

participant basis but discussions involving the whole group will also take place to increase the likelihood of peer reflection and support taking place.

Once the twelve participants have been selected they will be split into three groups. Each group will then be tutored once a fortnight for two hours over three months. This number is kept small because this project aim is to focus on each individual and produce an accurate study of their situation and their progress. At the outset a baseline on each participant’s digital skills and experience will be recorded. Any future progress will be measured against this baseline.

Trained Quarriers and GCIL facilitators will provide individually tailored support and tutoring to each participant. covering switching the computer on and off, keyboard and mouse use, opening and closing windows, internet use and safety, skype, email and on line shopping. Participant’s progress and uptake of technology will be tracked via outcomes from the Go On UK basic digital skills framework making use of, for example, online quizzes.

Over the year, the impact of having technology in their lives will be tracked to see if tackling the divide head on can bridge the gap.

### Planned project milestones

* Group 1 - 4 Participants - 1 start interview - 6 classes - 1 exit interview: Commences January 2016

* Group 2 - 4 Participants - 1 start interview - 6 classes - 1 exit interview: Commences May 2016

* Group 3 - 4 Participants - 1 start interview - 6 classes - 1 exit interview: Commences September 2016

* Completed report edited and printed for distribution: December 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* The primary outcome of this project is to produce an Action Research report which will look in detail at twelve ‘stories’ from the digital divide and to attempt to find why people are digitally excluded. The report will be an evolution of the existing data and learning currently on digital inclusion and participation, and will introduce a more in depth level of study than previously achieved.  This insight should be able to inform other projects and groups working with the target group in this project on how best to tackle the digital divide. Recommendations will be made the final report which will outline how this can be achieved.

* A second outcome of this project is that the participants of the study will be trained in the use of technology at no cost to themselves. Proper training with specialist staff knowledge of accessibility options can be very expensive. In this instance, the participants will have access to training throughout the project, and their individual stories will help to inspire others who may be facing similar situations to participate digitally. The participants will learn how to navigate their devices, email and video call, browse the internet, fill out forms online and how to stay safe online. The participants will also be able to retain the devices after the study is complete, which has removed a cost barrier. Very often, people can attend basic digital skills classes with no way to continue learning at home. In this instance, all participants will be able to achieve all the benefits of training for practical use outside the class.

* The final outcome is that Go4IT, GCIL and all the organisations who have referred others to the project will have their profiles raised by an important landmark study which tackles the very core of the digital divide. This improved profile will lead to others learning more of the digital inclusion and learning services on offer, and spread information about how to help others become digital participants.

### First Group Update (Jan - Apr 2016)

The first four participants in our study are getting on very well learning how to use the tablets purchased. This group of four people has a good representation of the groups we are working with: people with disabilities, the elderly and those facing economic deprivation, so already we have lots of information about why these groups have become digitally excluded, and why it was a difficult ‘gap’ to bridge without support.

As a team (Quarriers working with the Glasgow Centre for Inclusive Living) we are really excited to see the difference this training and technology has brought to people’s lives already, as far from being a socially inhibiting practice (computers vs people) it has shown technology to open even more social avenues (computers as a social enhancer) through confidence, knowledge and being more able to fuller interact with the world around them.

During this six session course for the first group, we have had an initial interview with each person and the training team. This was crucial and gave us a good background on what people were facing in their lives, and how technology was either creating a barrier, and what they hoped to achieve in terms of embracing technology. Then we have been teaching every second week with a week between, on essentials of tablet use such as navigating the devices and installing apps. This two week gap between classes is going to change down to weekly with the rest of the groups, just to enable the project to finish in time. Our most recent class was on using camera and gallery options to take pictures and edit them, then share via email. People were having great fun with some face swapping apps, and it was excellent to see how much moods were lightened through the use of technology.

We have two more training sessions for our first group before a breather and follow up session, and then we’ll be starting with the second group in May. Our publication, ‘Stories from the Digital Divide’ is due to be edited by November and printed in early December for distribution to all parties with an interest in this work. I do feel that as a team we are tackling the digital divide head on, and I believe at the end there will exist a crucial resource for the third sector for the road map ahead for people in need.

We'll add some pictures from next week's session, so please check back and see how we are getting on.

### Second Group Update (May - Jul 2016)

The second group in our 'Stories from the Digital Divide' project again presented a range of various barriers towards digital inclusion. Represented in the group were attention deficits, older adults, ABI, physical barriers via upper limb disability and visual impairment, lack of confidence, memory recall issues, and general learning disabilities. Again, many in the group have experienced social deprivation through unemployment and had difficulty in using technology in the past.

Similar to the first group, there were a number of barriers created by the persons circumstances which posed the greatest challenge in teaching during the six classes. One attendee often required others to help support in using everyday objects, and this also affected use of the tablet outside the class. As the person has difficulties in communicating, it's possible that even if wanting to use the tablet outside of the class, this may have gone unnoticed. Another member, whose circumstances had led to some amount of depression, had felt undermotivated to learn. It really highlighted to us that no matter the teaching involved, or the access to equipment, the outside, general living environment has such an important role to play in the adoption of technology (and in fact, any learning).

Despite these barriers, everyone engaged well with the course, and there was a positive atmosphere in the training room. Everyone completed the classes given, and learned about how to use their tablets. Each week they were charged and ready to use, and people managed to stay within their data usage limits. Three out of the four group members were close to absolute beginner level and real progress was made during this time to teach new skills. In the follow up sessions, all members were still making use of the tablets, and we'll be really interested to meet these group members at the end of the project to see how they are getting on. We are still on target for our final write up in December which will highlight in detail (anonymously) the barriers faced, and effective ways to tackle them.

### Third Group Update (Aug - Oct 2016)

The third group continued the trend we experienced in the project by our four individuals representing diverse groups of people who are digitally excluded. These diversities included autistic spectrum disorder in two cases, physical disabilities such as upper limb restrictive movement, wheelchair reliance and a certain amount of visual impairment. One elderly individual was retired and also presented a learning disability alongside all others to varying degrees.

It was also a relatively young group, with three quarters being under the thirty year age mark. Learners struggled with being able to cope with most of the basic digital skills which were queried at the beginning of this group. This did not stop many of the learners from being involved with their tablets. Within the first two weeks, all users were able to switch on their tablet and knew how to open and use the apps which they liked. One asd user, despite having little knowledge of computers, was able to download and install many different apps. There was a gap here, and in one other learner, in having a language barrier. These individuals were learning apps by memory for what they actual did, not what the text explained about them. Sometimes this was less evident in more 'picture based' apps, but was shown very clearly on text searches with google, and form filling online.

The group worked well with the tutors in terms of progress, and a lot of their interest was fueled by access to multimedia, such as music, video and cause and effect apps with gaming. None of these required particularly high levels of basic digital skills to access however. As with most other groups, throughout the six week course, learners were very good at charging up their tablet and trying some apps out at home. Data use was not large in this group, and another issue was still centred around the understanding of different amounts of data. Overall, the group did make good progress in terms of practical tablet and internet use, but fell short of making large strides in achieving basic digital skills as outlined by Go On UK.

### Evaluation

Stories from the Digital Divide set out to find the reasons why some people remain digitally excluded. Despite the training, which took account of various barriers, most learners did not significantly advance their basic digital skills according to the GoOn Uk basic digital skills definitions.  But that is not to say that learners did not significantly advance their understanding of digital skills.

All twelve learners were able to use their tablets in ways which they were not able to do before. Most learners could pick up their tablet, switch it on and navigate the tablet to areas of their own interest. Sometimes this was games, sometimes the browser for online surfing, and at other times, apps such as the camera or YouTube. Many learners were also able to change settings on their tablet, such as screen rotation, brightness, and to a lesser extent, toggle between Wi-Fi and mobile data.

It is concluded that this group of learners did take away real digital skills, but at a level below what is considered within the Go On  UK framework. Although the basic skills framework makes logical sense, it is clear that individuals at the extreme fringe of digital exclusion may never fully engage with the skills required to match this. That does not mean that training should not take place with this group, but that perhaps another more generalised layer of basic skills are required to signify that individuals are computer literate in other important ways. Currently these basic skills are not captured by the existing framework as the level is too advanced, and thus masks the learning.

### Lessons learned

There are always going to be limitations for what a classroom, or training course, can offer individual learners. Following on from this project, the ‘golden standards’ which could be aimed for, are as follows:

* Planning for differentiation in materials and tuition. What works for one person does not always work for another. Using a range of techniques and approaches in conjunction with each other, means there will be something for everyone.

* 1-1 training is essential for overcoming the barriers faced by learners. a complaint often heard by each group was that previous learning was not 1-1 and they had felt left behind, or forced to rush their learning.

* Social networks in the physical world and supports out with the classroom are essential to ensuring the learning continues, and is utilised beyond the formal training.

* Using an approach to learning which creates interest and fun is important. The learners were most engaged when they were able to enjoy the things they created, and when they took part in group activities.

* Formulation of a clear learning plan and achievable goals. Avoid setting unrealistic expectations. For instance, a person who is not literate, will not be able to achieve the same through web browsing as someone with more refined language skills.

* An initial assessment of learners needs and existing skills is essential to setting the appropriate pace of learning for individual learners.
