### Project description

Our aim at G.R.A.C.E is to establish a Digital Well Being Cafe within Hillhead Community Centre from where we currently deliver our services. In recognition of our clients needs and the ongoing societal demands for digital literacy we have urgent need to establish an IT suite through which we can offer supported digital literacy learning workshops to adults who have become socially incapacitated or isolated through traumatic life events, mental health issues, poverty, unemployment & poor socioeconomic placing, and or, addiction related issues.

The IT suite will be available throughout the working week for members to use and the key aims we need to meet through implementing our Digital Well Being Cafe are to furnish participants with a digital literacy skills foundation that will:

* Encourage self-directed endeavour utilising digital technologies

* Promote confidence in engaging with digital based social mediums and communities

* Build and promote confidence in using digital technologies as a way of engaging with others and thereby reduce social isolation and exclusion and promote social capacity

* Reduce anxiety and promote confident engagement with today’s high tech society with particular focus on understanding and accessing benefits through online government services such as Universal Credit & Job Search

* Enable self-supported problem solving in the use of and engagement with digital technology and the digital world

* Empower individuals with a sound grasp of terminology and jargon relating to digital technologies and mediums

* Enable greater understanding and communication within the family setting when dealing with digital technology and related mediums, particularly between parent and child

* Find people better placed to move onto positive destinations in relation to education, training and or employment

In addition to training on laptops we will explore other technologies such as phones, tablets, midi controllers, cameras etc

A visiting facilitator Rikki Traynor will conduct digital literacy workshops offering personal tuition and group lead digital based learning activities, Rikki has over two years experience in working with G.R.A.C.E and has the unique attributes that afford him the ability to nurture and support a person on a recovery journey, whilst possessing industry recognised IT skills and an ability to teach such in a way that is appropriate and accessible to all those who engage with G.R.A.C.E.

For G.R.A.C.E it is all about providing services and training which develop people’s ability to prevent themselves from reaching crisis point and relapsing.  This innovative project is not just about individuals developing digital literacy skills, the digital cafe will be implemented to work in tandem with our other projects and services, this project is about empowerment, it is about supporting people as they seek to achieve full independence in life, it is about enabling individuals to play their part in shaping the world that is shaping them.

### Planned project milestones

* Managing information & Problem solving workshops will be delivered: February 2016

* Communicating & Problem Solving workshops will be delivered: May 2016

* Creating, Transacting & Problem Solving will be delivered: October 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Our primary outcome objective is that Basic Digital Literacy Attainment is acheived by all those who engage

* Inter-personal skills development through Digital Literacy Training to provide a safe environment where each individual has an equal voice and equal opportunity to express thoughts and ideas

### Evaluation

Milestone One

In late November of last year G.R.A.C.E was in a period of transition with quite a few regular participants moving on to pastures new and quite a few new comers engaging with G.R.A.C.E for the first time. With this and the onset of Christmas approaching we felt it best to delay our start to early January of the new year

Milestone One January – March

Weeks one to four; 'The Wrong Browsers'

Over this initial four week period many puns, jokes have been made about 'The Wrong Browsers' and through humour we have ventured forth as a group to explore which browsers best fit our individual needs.
Initial group discussions revealed a great deal of confusion with regards to terminology and understanding of what the internet is and how best to access it.
The analogy of comparing the internet to one library with many different entrances best suited our purpose

We explored this idea in depth, looking at three main entrances, and how the same library, 'the internet' was presented differently when entered via:

Mozilla Firefox
Internet Explorer
Google Chrome

We also explored the idea that each library entrance presented a number of assistants to help us navigate the library i.e. search engines:

Bing
Yahoo
Google

The following is an example of a simple quiz sheet we used to spark exploration and discussion that focused on each browsers characteristics and strengths and weaknesses:

Use Mozilla to find the answer to the following three questions, cut and paste your answers into the spaces below each question:

1	When was Mozilla launched ?




2	What is tech house ?




3.	When was the first message sent by email ?



Use Internet Explorer to find the answer to the following three questions, cut and paste your answers into the spaces below each question:

1	When was Internet Explorer launched ?




2	Who was the last person on the moon ?




3	How do you enter safe mode ?



Use Google Chrome to find the answer to the following three questions, cut and paste your answers into the spaces below each question:


1	When was Google Chrome launched ?



2	How much is 23.50 euros in sterling ?




3	Who published the first ever web page and in what year ?

Simple quizzes like this have been brilliant for introducing more challenging problems to the group for example:
Although each laptop had Internet Explorer readily installed we had to download and install both Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox
Before setting off on this quiz, as a group, we had to identify download and install a suitable office package...............in this case Apache Open Office, an open source package which is free and very similar in nature, and interchangeable with, Microsoft Office.
This exercise also allowed us to introduce simple shortcuts and techniques for lifting information from one medium to another.

Weeks five to ten

Tailoring our Browsers for a Better Fit

These weeks were spent fully exploring the nuts and bolts of the three browsers and how best we can take charge of them and arrange them to suit our individual needs.

Tackling one annoyance highlighted by many as a constant source of angst and for many a generator of fear and uncertainty; pop ups and adverts launching in separate windows, we looked at useful plug ins and add on's for our browsers, for those of us unfamiliar with 'Ad-Block' it's discovery is something akin to the unveiling of a true modern miracle worker.

Exploring the different types of plug ins and add ons available for browsers, and how to install them, and control them, gave our members real confidence in taking charge of their browsers, many for the first time expressing relief and that at last they felt they had some idea of what was going on when they went online, for the first time they felt they had some control over their computer rather than their computer being in control of them............

We explored setting home pages, privacy settings and their importance, deleting history and it's importance when using public computers, identifying and checking web site addresses.....'am I on the right page'..................................

'Am I On The Right Page'..........This proved to be such an invaluable session for all, on many occasions people had been unwittingly accessing web content or downloading software from third party sites resulting in the unwanted installation of third party software and toolbars ….....

Bookmarks and how to use them was another very welcome session, we introduced folders, and different ways to organise and manage bookmarks, even some of our more experienced lap-toppers took a lot from this.......twenty bookmarks or more and things can start to get very unwieldy indeed.......

Throughout this time we have also been looking at developing an understanding of all the incredible things we can do with a mouse, many of our members at outset had very basic skills in this area, a few had none, when you don't know what your mouse is up to, things can get very frustrating, we quickly identified that a lot of folks were guessing with their double clicking, right click, left click, scrolling and the whole myriad of multiple functions a mouse has.......... no one wants to appear inept when sitting next to others clicking away, we found people tended to mask their fear of uncertainty..... tackling this in a fun way, we found, was the answer; we had a great time using online mouse click games and exercises to help people get to grips with and take control of the potential of their mouse.......... we also made some great music along the way....

Here's a few sites we investigated:

http://www.incredibox.com/

http://www.noisli.com/

http://www.pbclibrary.org/mousing/mousercise.htm

https://www.justpark.com/creative/reaction-time-test/

http://www.roomrecess.com/pages/ClickSpeed.html

We also did a lot of work investigating basic short cuts that are universal between browsers and software such as

Ctrl V …...	Paste

Ctrl C ….....	Copy

Ctrl A 	…....	Select All


Over the the weeks, we have also had a steady stream of GRACE members and friends of GRACE, dropping in with computer related problems and questions. One of the biggest problems is computers and laptops running at incredibly slow speeds and under performing, in most cases the primary cause has been malware and other such nasties. As each case has presented itself we have used each as an opportunity to problem solve. We have also introduced the idea of basic computer and laptop house keeping, Malwarebytes, CC Cleaner, and Avast antivirus software has now been installed on all our laptops, by participants, and all now feel confident in regularly checking their laptops are malware and virus free.
Other problems that are often presented usually follow a visit from teenage nieces, nephews, and grandchildren.............'I don't know what they did with it !'  We have looked at the basics of 'computer appearance' and taking charge of your desktop, and again browsers. This has on many occasions tied in with the use of Malwarebytes, it would seem that teenagers are quite adept at installing third party software that hi-jacks and changes browser behaviour !


In conclusion we would say that these past ten weeks have been very successful, this is clearly evident to our facilitator through recognising the relaxed demeanour in which participants now tackle problems they encounter, or in the way they set about tasks in a confident manner, perhaps the best indicator is the confidence with which people speak up and share information, ask questions, or help fellow participants, or new comers to the group. There is also a new found understanding that no one is ever an expert on all things computer based, but that answers and solutions can be found in many formats by 'googling...... '
