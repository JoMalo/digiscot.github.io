### Project description
We’re planning to provide an online shopper service via designated and trained helpers available for 2 hours on a Monday at the same time as our regular computer club (10am-12). The service will be for all tenants eventually but the 6 people identified will ’trial’ it initially. 2 are Club members who we expect will be able to shop online for themselves with minimal support by the end of the project. The other 4 tenants are less likely to be able to shop online independently longer term but will do so with support. This service will help both Viewpoint and support services to make better use of staff time and resources through the use of the internet as well as helping tenants tap into what is of benefit to them online. We hope that will encourage them to explore other things e.g. Skype, emailing relatives etc. Tap into IT will approach Asda (-whom we note are Digital Charter signatories) and other supermarkets, tenants and their relatives where appropriate to work out a way to minimise any risk of financial abuse to tenants or of putting Tap into IT employees/Volunteers in a vulnerable position e.g. by exploring prepayment cards or other ways of avoiding access to payment card details. This project is intended as a ’pilot’ for a service that can be purchased by Viewpoint and partner agencies and rolled out to tenants in other locations.

### Planned project milestones

* Tap into IT has explored prepayment options with Asda/other online supermarkets and got relevant legal advice and we have clearance from their insurers & ours on the terms & conditions of the service: December 2015

* Tap has met with each of the 6 individual tenants participating agreed terms & conditions of the service: December 2015

* Training of Tap into it sessional worker & Volunteer who’ll be delivering the training/support: January 2016

* Service starts in January till March on a trial basis, Monday mornings for 2 hours delivered by a Tap into it worker + Volunteer: March 2016

* Review and report back on the project with a view to rolling out the service to at least the 2 other locations with a computer club in 2016: March 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* 2 tenants able to shop online with minimal support

* 4 tenants unable to do their own shopping are involved in the process of choosing and ordering their own shopping online on a regular basis

* Online shopping becomes an attractive alternative option for all 35 tenants at Lynedoch extra care housing and encourages more interest among the 75+ year old age group to get online.

* New service can be replicated elsewhere with potential to free up Social Care staff and family time for other purposes or clients

### Evaluation

#### Goal
Support 6 older people, 2 of whom would be able to shop online with little or no ongoing support by the end of the pilot and 4 who would be able to do so with ongoing help.

#### Actual outcome
Supported 4 people. 1 person able to shop online independently, 1 who is likely to do so at the computer club, where help is available if need be and 2 who are involved in the whole process but with someone there to help.

#### How we got there including lessons learnt
- 2 meetings with members of Lynedoch Place computer club to discuss the idea of the service, who it was for? concerns? how do we let folk know about it? what else do we need to sort out? Through this, 3 club members volunteered as 'guinea pigs'. Also suggested an approach to 2 other tenants who are now housebound and dependant on others to do their shopping. It turned out that these 2 tenants were too unsure about the proposed service and declined. We decided to focus on developing the service with those ready to help us do so. The circumstances of one of our testers changed, meaning that she was unavailable for the duration of our 'pilot', but we managed to recruit another 2 shoppers from our other clubs. **Lesson learnt:** the importance of potential Service User input right from the start in designing a service that is really geared towards their needs as well as tapping into the enormous help they can offer in finding solutions to problems and overcoming obstacles.

- We also kept the Co-ordinator of Lynedoch and the Senior Management of the Housing Association fully informed and had their full support through the whole process, which has been crucial to the progress of it.

- Mike Ellis (Tap into IT Managing Director) had 3 prep meetings with Ranald Lillie (sub-contracted as one of the 'Digital Support Workers' along with me in delivering the service) and he was involved in one of the consultation meetings with tenants as well as preparing a powerpoint presentation about it and helping to draft the Terms and Conditions. **Lesson learnt:** the value of co-working!

- we did deliver 12 sessions but had to be flexible, taking into account health and other factors which meant having to postpone /reschedule and the fact that an older person living on their own my only need to do one big shop per fortnight or per month, so 3-4 sessions were spent per order initially! Great delight on completing that first shop though has been the response of all 4 of our shoppers though and subsequent orders are much quicker to put in and can be planned as needed.  **Lesson learnt:** be prepared to invest the time per 'shopper' to begin with, don't try to rush the process and you're service will be in demand once word gets around from your enthusiastic Service Users!

#### Goal
Minimise the risk of financial abuse or of putting the Online Shopper 'helpers' in a vulnerable position e.g. through use of a prepayment card, seeking legal advice as appropriate.

#### Actual outcome
We did contact Asda and got information on prepayment cards but didn't see them as a workable option in practice - would add another layer of complication to the process, where it needs to be as simple as possible. Similarly for other options we considered including Tap IT handling payments & recharging tenants/service users. But could we take the risk of assisting tenants to use their own payment cards? We decided to get legal advice. With the help of Alastair Keatinge, Head of Charities and Social Enterprise at Lindsay's Solicitors, we agreed a risk management plan which included

- applying for Protection of Vulnerable Group (PVG) scheme membership for Digital Support Workers who would be delivering the Online Shopper Service. This involved getting the approval of Disclosure Scotland, after a process of negotiation through several emails and phone calls, to add this job role to those for which a PVG can be requested.

- drafting our Online Shopper Service Terms and Conditions that we go through with service users prior to starting.

**Lessons learnt overall:** When pioneering a new type of service with potential to make a big difference to people's choice, independence, self-respect and other 'quality of life' outcomes, stay focussed on the value of it,be prepared to take risks but make the case for the changes that will allow it to happen as safely as possible.

#### Goal
Be in a position to roll out this service to tenants/others in other Viewpoint Housing locations and elsewhere. Promote it to Council Heath and Social Care Dept as another option to those requiring help with shopping.

#### Outcome
We now have a service that is available to those with the capacity to understand what they are signing up to and the funds to pay for it.

### Next steps

We have work to do on

- marketing it effectively

- identifying who we liaise with in Edinburgh Council HSC Dept about this service follow the considerable restructuring and loss of former contacts.

- being able to recruit additional Digital Support Workers with PVG scheme membership as need arises.

- once the service is established i.e. has been in operation on a regular basis for a year for at least 20 customers, we need to consider how we can address the issues involved in extending it to those who don't have the capacity to understand its terms and conditions e.g through those with Power of Attorney for them.
