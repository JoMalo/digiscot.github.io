### Project description

The project will provide basic digital inclusion tuition & learning to 32 disabled & older people to enhance their use of digital technology, both for their own wellbeing & also their participation in community activities such as volunteering & other community involvement.

The project will work with other organisations to identify & engage with disabled & older people who have little or no knowledge or digital skills. The project will specifically seek to engage with those who face barriers in digital technology use in maintaining & developing their financial inclusion & wellbeing, community involvement & contact through volunteering & other activities.

The project will deliver one to one & small group tuition that is tailored to participants own needs & learning pace, & will also provide accessible hardware & software & communication support to facilitate their learning. The project will also lend equipment (laptops, tablets & mobile broadband connection) to learners where appropriate.
Each learner will have a learning plan that sets out their areas of interest a goals for using digital technology, both for personal use & as a skill for volunteering & future employment. Learner progress will be tracked through our existing monitoring systems & will also include the DigiSkills checklist.

The project will provide tuition on a wide variety of digital topics, which will be identified by learners own needs (both individually & through focus groups & our learner forum). ICOD currently provide tuition on: PC & Laptop Basics, Tablet/ipad Basics, Internet & Email, Social Networks, Internet Safety, Online Shopping & Banking, Skype & Video Communication, Word Processing, Spreadsheets, Desktop Publishing & Digital Photography.

Where appropriate ICOD can provide certificated learning in partnership with our local libraries & community learning & development team in SVQ Introduction to Computing & ECDL units. Our certified courses are also delivered on a one to one or small group basis at learners own pace, to ensure that they receive the appropriate time & support to successfully complete courses.

Learning will be delivered in a variety of locations, including our own Learning Zone, learners local libraries or community centres or in learners own homes (as part of our existing learning activities ICOD has developed a home learning service for those who cannot easily access community learning).
Tuition will be delivered through ICOD Tutors who have extensive knowledge & experience in delivering accessible digital learning to people with a wide variety of impairments.
Learners will be encouraged & have access to our other services, including advice on benefits & housing issues, financial capability training, social group activity & our community link workers to develop participation in other community activities. Learners will also be encouraged to join our Learners Forum, helping us to identify future service development &provision.
