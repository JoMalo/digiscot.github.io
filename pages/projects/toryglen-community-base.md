Phase three: Ongoing use of facility, service accessed throughout the year for various learning activity

### Phase 2 February 2015

Marketing of service including recruitment of participants.

**Update**  With no local library and the levels of deprivation higher than the Glasgow average the marketing of the computer suite has been welcomed by many.  Advertising was done through the local housing newsletter, leaflets in shop windows, doctors/dentist surgeries, school gates, etc.  Moreover, a large network was reached by e-mail and facebook as well as attending networking events to promote this facility.




**Update:** Basic and Intermediate IT classes have started and participants are enjoying using the new equipment as well as the new software which has been installed. A Job Club has also been started which is well attended by many who benefit from efficient computers.  Job Centre Plus refer also many people with little or no computer skills in order to receive support with on-line job searches, applications, etc.

**Update**  Currently recruiting (May 15) for a Digital Photography course and in discussions to set up a Community Journalism course.  We are also supporting Toryglen Youth Club to offer a specialised Job Club service to 16 - 19 year olds.

### Phase 3 February - July 2015

Ongoing use of facility to support training, digital skills clubs, job clubs and community access


**Update:** Our job club who use the computer suite have remarked on the speed of the computers now and how this has helped with their job searches.

Our computer suite is also open to the public and they too are enjoying the benefits of the new computers. On average there are over 50 members of our community who access the computer suite on a weekly basis.

**Update**  This number will increase as more specialised groups are interested in running IT specialised courses.  WSREC are discussing over 55's BME IT classes and a BME Job club from Toryglen Community Base.  A local "Reminiscence" group also utilises the IT suite when required.  Within the Base, Urban Roots an environmental project use the suite with their volunteers to undertake project work.  Other groups such as First Steps confidence building will use computers to undertake personality testing and Next Steps employability course will use the computers for CV creation and on-line programmes to identify skills and strenghts.

## Evaluation

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project promoted digital inclusion for local residents. The installation of the initial IT Suite led to the development of a new partnership with the Wheatly Group, GHA and Glasgow Kelvin College who supported us to further develop and upgrade the facilities and install a new Click and Connect Learning Centre.  The IT Suite enabled us to widen participation in learning for people from disadvantaged communities.

**In terms of outputs since January 2015 we have delivered:**

•	127 training sessions were delivered

•	328 local people participated in training and 96 Job Club sessions were delivered

•	3600 local people dropped in to access our services, IT Suite and telephone facilities


**In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has:**

•	Improved access to training and learning opportunities for local people

•	Widened participation in learning for people who experience disadvantage

•	Promoted digital inclusion for local people


We know this because we conducted a short survey with 10% of people using the service. The feedback demonstrated that as a result of accessing the IT Suite and/or Training: 100% of local residents felt the facilities offered were excellent; 98% felt their skills and confidence had improved since accessing the service; 100% felt their use of IT would increase as a result of accessing the service and 80% felt they were more likely to progress to work, volunteering or further training as a result of accessing the service.

### Lessons learned

**Things that worked well:**

1.	The initial installation of the new IT equipment ultimately led to the creation of a new partnership and the creation of our Click and Connect Learning Centre

2.	The IT suite enabled us to extend the range of training courses and services offered at the Base

3.	Having access to on-line job search services supported the delivery of our Job Club

**Things that we would do differently next time:**

1.	Develop more robust systems to support project monitoring and evaluation

2.	During this period Toryglen Community Base had a very basic website and it was difficult to manage the content which impacted on our ability to market our range of services.  This has now been rectified www.toryglencommunitybase.org

3.	We would improve our marketing by conducting door to door outreach services
