## Project plan

### Project description

The Creative Digital Club (CDC) will be a project that uses creative digital activities as a platform to engage with hard to reach individuals, develops skills, positive activities, encourages independence and resilience and nurtures individuals to take steps towards developing new interests, training, education or employment.

## Project Milestones

### Phase 1

Plan delivery of digital creative club, establish links with stakeholders and obtain equipment.

We've been shopping for all our new digital equipment and have teamed up with Citizens Online to run a Digital Champions Course. Our first four week course starts next Tuesday and we're already oversubscribed.

### Update June 2015

Our first Digital Champions Course is done, we had 8 people through and everyone got something from it. One of our participants said "I've never used a tablet before....I thought it was just for gaming" and "this is amazing, how can I help others get online?" Famous words and phrases so far "Oh that's what that thingy button does" and "What? You can even do that on Google?"

We had such great feedback and an appetite from people for wanting to learn more and tell all their mates about it we decided to run a Digital Champions Train the Trainer course. That's just finished and we now have 3 Digital Champion Trainers available and oh my goodness, it's making such a difference already. We've identified that "Digital Life Skills" are essential but that for our client group, access to digital equipment to get online is as much of an issue.

So, onto phase 2 we go. We've recruited 2 digital volunteers and we're just about to take on our own premises and set up a digital cafe. More information to follow so watch this space.

### Phase 2

Homeless Club: Deliver digital creative club for people who are homeless.

Establish individual learning plans and record baseline of skills. Deliver pre-employability digital skills and looking for work skills. Create virtual blogs to record progress. Use Digital photography and video equipment to upload to virtual blogs

### Update June 2015

Skills Development Scotland have been training us to help others use "My World of Work". We're registered as a partner agency on the website which means we can help people use resources like the "My DNA" and "My strengths" sections which we think are excellent pre-employability tools for all ages and abilities. And it's great for building on your digital skills confidence. So far we've helped 9 people to use this site and print off their own "career personality and individual strengths profile"

In our Digital Creative Club for the homeless we've been having fun, from digital photography to having a go at community journalism and making an "oh my goodness it's so bad I can't upload it" digital film recorded on an iphone. With thanks to Citizens Online the group has developed the confidence to produce a weekly "what's on for free" bulletin for Inverness and is available on our facebook page with links to all the events. We've found rubber duck races, lego exhibitions, street parties and zombie rehearsals so far!

### Phase 3

Women's Club: Deliver digital creative club for women.

Establish individual learning plans and record baseline of skills. Deliver digital life skills training to include emails, internet searching and shopping, online services. Use digital photography to create virtual webpage and virtual online etsy shop.

### Update November 2015

Woohoo! We've become an online learning centre with the Tinder Foundation and can deliver online basics and digital life skills courses. So far we've enrolled 16 female learners and 3 have achieved their City and Guilds Online Basics award through us. At our women's only group on a Wednesday we've been researching some websites for free creative and craft ideas. The group have also been helping take photos of our ceramics being made and uploading them to our Etsy shop. One of our lovely ladies has been making bracelets and has just set up her own online shop.

### Phase 4

Offender's Club: Deliver digital creative club for offenders.

### Update September 2015

We've moved into our new premises and are getting ready to start our digital creative club for offenders. Next week we're starting a free digital cafe for offenders as a first port of call on the day they're released from prison. We'll be helping them with digital life skills like getting an email and accessing services as well as providing better off advice on things like electric metered supply comparison sites. We'll also be offering free internet access for our tech savvy service users who wouldn't be able to afford to access the internet otherwise. One of our digital champions has been fervently researching good websites, links and nuggets of digital gold to come up with a resource pack for our digicafe.

Establish individual learning plans and record baseline of skills. Deliver digital radioskills training to create virtual radio programme. Establish whether Ofcom will grant temporary or restricted internet radio license. Establish budget for running internet radio station beyond the timescale of the digital creative club.

### Update January 2016

We've helped 22 people after they've left prison by signing them up with a free online learning account and our digital cafe has been a success. We've used refurbished tablets and laptops from another social enterprise called Reboot in Forres that recycles computers destined for the bin! Unfortunately, we've not been able to deliver the radioskills training and the costs of obtaining even a restricted radio license were prohibitive for us to take forward the idea of running a radio station.

## Evaluation

We've achieved and surpassed the majority of the outcomes we set out to deliver and learned some valuable lessons along the way.

### Outputs and outcomes

In terms of outputs we have:

- Trained 3 digital champion trainers
- Recruited 5 digital champion volunteers
- Facilitated 35 digital cafe sessions
- We've become a UK Online learning centre and signed up 28 learners
- We've helped 25 learners gain digital life skills and 3 learners achieve a City and Guilds Online Basics qualification
- We've helped 1 learner to set up their own online shop

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has achieved:

- Engagement with hard to reach individuals (we know this because we have worked with people who would not normally access digital support or have access to the internet)
- Increased confidence in online basics skills (we know this because over 80% of the people we've supported have successfully completed an online basics course or award and are now using the internet independently)
- Increased employability skills (we know this because 92% of employers require their employees to have online basics skills and it is a key requirment to put on a CV)
- Increased independence and resilience (we know this because 74% of the people we have supported are now able to access services online that they could not before, have their own email address and have learned how to use a tablet or ipad device for more than gaming)

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. Digital Champion Volunteers are a super resource and if they come from similar backgrounds as other learners they can offer even more support and understadning
2. Internet access is vital and yet not affordable for some households, so a digital cafe offering free internet access for disadvantaged groups has proven to be a valuable asset to the community
3. Gaining confidence and competence in online basics is a valuable employability skill that over 92% of employers say is essential.

Things that we would do differently next time:

1. Not try and do too much, it's better to focus on one or two things and do them well, rather than try and take on too much
2. Continue to campaign for online courses and digital life skills to be available in prisons
3. Shift our focus with digital life skills to become more person centred
