## Project plan

### Project description

Employ an IT tutor and an intepreter to promote, develop and teach introductory IT skills to older members of SHIMCA.


**Update July 2015:**

Classes have now started with around 5 people attending each class. Topics covered in the class vary and depend on each persons indiviudal need. So far participants are at differing levels of experience and the tutor is able to cater to this and deliver focused tuition. Student feedback so far has been positive with students stating that they feel more confident and that using a computer is no longer such of a challenge. One student has taken particular pleasure in learning how to shop online. The youngest participant is currently 14yrs old and although in many ways more computer savvy than the others, he is still finding that there are things covered in the class which he doesn't know about. The tutor has kindly agreed to continue with the teaching past the summer holidays so that more people will be available to join the class and make the most of the support and training on offer. As well as SHIMCA members classes are also open to the wider community and are free to attend.
