### Evaluation

This small project supported two groups of people aged 65+ who live in Retirement Housing in Dornoch and Tain to learn relevant digital skills for communication, broadening their interests, networks and generally enhancing their lives by taking them on a digital journey where they move from paper to getting online using our tried and tested Getting Digital course. The courses were delivered for us by the excellent Lucy Hawkins.

Two iPads and a Micosoft Surface tablet with keyboard were used in the training, as well as laptops and tablets belonging to learners. Despite problems with accessing WiFi at both locations, both groups were very positive about their learning experiences. The most common learning need expressed was to navigate the internet and use email. This and other needs were addressed in part by the systematic use of Lead Scotland's 'Getting Digital' training modules but much of the training was also on a more informal, demand-responsive basis.

One learner at each centre was able to help as support volunteers. They came every week and were able to help others with specific questions. One volunteer was very helpful in showing others his digital photo library on Photoshop and we had a very interesting session when he showed us how he manipulated images.

In Dornoch, we set up three learners with an email account and they connected with family and sent pictures to other members of the group.  One man who was very confident on the computer was able to help show them how to edit some of their photos.  Those using Laptops were able to save them to a file.  We used Google and YouTube as search engines to search for various items of interest, and also to show them how to access their emails from other devices.  All the learners confidence grew in the use of the computers, and they took away some printed information on email set up, email access and basic vocab and icons on their devices.

In Tain, we set up two learners with an email account.  One lady has since bought an iPad and is now using it independently.  We looked at how to keep email inboxes neat and tidy and spoke at great lengths about keeping safe online.  One learner bought an item online for the first time and is now much happier about using online stores to buy things.  We were able to retrieve two learners' email accounts and they now have a better understanding of how to access them and what they need to remember. I also introduced some of the learners to some of the online learning options that are available and at least one is hoping to sign up to an online course.

In both locations, the timings of the course very good, with people able to come to the classes without missing out on other vital services. Nevertheless, there was considerable variation in numbers attending each week. The information on the course was well understood and the learners were happy that it delivered what they expected. The devices we had to use were great to be able to show them the options available, and to show them what each could do.

This course was valuable to this group of learners.  We were able to support them in a familiar environment and allow them to grow in confidence and peer support each other. The flexibility of the structure allowed each learner to identify their own needs and allowed the trainer to offer tailored support.

We can say that we have supported these individuals and have helped shape their future in the digital world. One of the learners now joins another group that meets to learn about the internet so she can continue her learning.

We are grateful to Cairn Housing Association and their staff for supporting this training and helping us to recruit learners.
