## Project plan

### Project description

It is proposed to extend the existing services provided by the project to meet the needs of service users by offering basic computer skills, job search support and literacy and numeracy support. This will be provided by volunteers initially. Working with other providers the facility will be offered out with project times more generally to support online job search. Our aim is to help our clients to gain skills and confidence to move on to more mainstream learning and so widen their social circles away from the chaotic lifestyles they lead

•	Participants will gain basic ICT skills

•	Participants will gain confidence in using computers for job search

•	Participants will be able to search the internet and send emails

•	Participants will improve reading writing, spelling and number skills

•	Participants will gain confidence to move on to other learning environments, thus widening their social  circles away from the lifestyles they are leading

Learning will take place on a one to one or small group basis depending on individual needs. A Job Club will also be run to support people undertaking job search on line, write CVs and apply for jobs. The Project will operate initially within the Drop – in hours, with participants wishing to use the Job Club coming in before Drop – in. It is anticipated that these hours will change as the Learning Zone becomes established


## Project Update

The project is currently supporting between 17 & 20 people per day. 3 or 4 individuals are using computers for the first time. A couple are using them to search for jobs and a couple are completing applications for college.

A lot of users experience chaotic lifestyles and do not feel comfortable or welcome in a library setting. This project provides them with the opportunity to use computers and learn basic digital skills in a place that is comfortable, and where they have plenty of support from tutors.


## Evaluation

Whilst our Learning Zone Project has not progressed as fast as we had anticipated, due to our volunteer tutor leaving the project to take up employment, we have been supporting a large number of our service users to access ICT in a number of ways.

### Outputs and outcomes

Two women have been supported to learn how to use the computer and can now confidently use the keyboard and mouse. In the main they have been using ICT for word-search and other literacy activities to improve reading and spelling. This however, has not been on a regular basis because of lack of volunteers.

We do work with service users on a daily basis to access ICT for other purposes:
4 people have used the computers for their job search. Service users can access the project before Drop-in times to complete their searches for the Job Centre. While one was able to use ICT, the other three have improved their skills and can now independently carry out their job searches.

Two people have compiled CVs with support.

Most support is given on a one to one basis helping service users complete on line forms for benefits, housing etc., search the internet and write letters and emails.

Because of lack of trained volunteers, support in the main has been reactive rather than proactively offering learning programmes. We are, however addressing this by putting together a funding bid to develop our project which will include employing a tutor for the Learning Zone. In the meantime we liaise with Communities Service where appropriate to refer service users on.

While we have lost our volunteer tutor, we can’t lose sight of the fact that she too, through helping set up Learning Zone and volunteering has gained the skills and confidence to move into employment herself.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. Service users access to centre & computers prior to drop-ins
2. One to one support

Things that we would do differently next time:

1. Employ a tutor so that support can be more consistent and learning programmes can be offered
