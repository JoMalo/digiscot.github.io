Week 1
Great opening to the 10 week sessions.  After a shaky start with signing in, our young assisstants helped everyone get online and get started, and our tutors were able to obtain information about which topics future sessions would cover.  This week we had 9 participants with different needs and aspirations but with a common goal - to gain confidence with using the internet.
Week 2
A few new faces this week with more questions to answer.  Our tutors have been very busy andhave had great help from our young assisstants who have a great knowledge of many devices.

Week 3
Nice to see everyone again.  A few newcomers and some others off on their holidays.  So far we have given overviews on using Email, searching the internet and given a few tips on using Excel Spreadsheets.  We have also helped with a lady who was having problems understanding where her documents went when she saved them.
Participants are bringing a mix of equipment - laptops and tablets.
We have helped with a variety of technical queries and are looking into some free online learning courses for some.

Week 6 - Reasons for the sessions success
One of the participants wanted some help finding out about a family event back in 1910; I made a few suggestions for sources of information and immediately she very confidently open her search engine and starting typing. I commented on her speed and she told me that because of the classes she is no longer apprehensive about using her computer and is therefore using it lots more.

Amongst the group we have a couple who are going through change as the husband has just been diagnosed with Dementia. In the first few weeks they didn't know how to use the tablet they had been given. Last week we helped them find their Diamond wedding photos, taken on the tablet but lost to them. They were thrilled to see them again. They are over 80 and don't always keep in good health but the class is a reason for them to come to Tain and socialise.

Similar to the above, a lady from out of town with a sick husband, looks forward every week to her opportunity to get out and learn something new. Unfortunately one week she couldn't come because of the doctor's house call. On his way out the doctor  reminded her to have time for herself, she retorted with "you could help by not visiting on a Wednesday morning as I should be at my computer class now, it's the highlight of my week!" We are helping her learn Excel.

Update for October

This month has been varied as always and also involved helping a number of the participants with booking train tickets.  A group of ladies who come each week have decided to take a trip to Thurso on the train. They planned the journey while at the session.  One gentleman was trying to arrange his train travel to Perth at home on Wednesday morning and as he got confused he remembered that the class was on.  He was thrilled when One f the young helpers managed to help him sort the booking out.  hE then had a good time showing me on Google Maps and Google Earth where his family live in that area.

One of the helpers and learners have set up a bond.  She was a new user and seeing the same tutor each week has helped her develop her skills.  Another tutor was working with a learner, who has mastered ordering his repeat prescriptions via the Doctors' Surgery website.  His wife can't attend every week due to an art class but after I told them about the possibility of using TouchNote to create cards, she arrived with some water colour paintings to use.




## Evaluation

Our 10 week project has proved very sucessful with an average of approximately 10 learners per week.
Here is a selection of the feedback comments

The course has been very helpful.  I now have more confidence and I use the computer more regularly.  The instruction is first class.

I am now more likely to search the internet and more confident to look for new sites.

I have gained more confidence in the use of my laptop.  The instructors have been very helpful.

Here are some videos of our learners experiences

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project has allowed people to develop their confidence of using the internet.  It has also enabled people to find information on their own need and interests and learn from experienced instructors.


In terms of outcomes for local community, we have encouraged a group of participants to meet on a weekly basis and share learning and social experineces together in a friendly environment.
The local ASDA cafe has provided a great venue.  It is easily accessible, has reliable wifi, has great car parking and is a good place to come and meet with friends.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. Venue
2. Young tutor assistants from local school
3. Experienced tutors with knowledge of technical and social aspects of the internet.
