### Project description

The project will target ethnic minority women who have been working with Saheliya & progressed enough to be in a position to cope with the language & learning demands of basic computing classes. We will work in partnership utilising the expertise of the Digital Skills Academy (DSA) to deliver a high quality learning programme which will offer Microsoft Digital Literacy certification.

The project will give the learners essential skills to help with the process of integration & employment which they have embarked on with Saheliya. The project will have a significant impact on the women we will support, giving them the skills to enable them to search for & obtain work, access public & consumer services, pay bills, search for cost savings for utilities & goods, have social contact with others & even keep up with their children’s activities online.

Giving people the skills they are expected to have automatically by the welfare system, enables them to meet Jobcentre expectations & help avoid the possibility of sanctions which are having a major impact on people living in poverty.

The project will be delivered in Saheliya premises where learners can access existing equipment in the form of PCs, laptops & tablets. They will also access in-house childcare which will facilitate their learning. This combination of expert digital learning support & the emotional & practical support offered by Saheliya makes this project unique.

The classes will be delivered in 2 half-day sessions per week by an experienced IT trainer & will run for up to 8 weeks. We plan for 6-7 people in each class (12 per week) who will be supported by at least 1 volunteer. We will run 3 of these classes over the course of one year.

We plan to recruit volunteers from Saheliya clients who have more advanced IT skills. Our evidence from working with clients is that there is a sufficient number of more highly educated & experienced clients to provide this aspect of the service. The evidence of DSA is that the role of volunteers is crucial to ensure individualised learning can be achieved.
Individual assessments will take place at the start of each course to enable an individualised learning plan to be developed for each learner. The use of volunteers enables the learners to develop at their own pace. In addition, we plan to engage at least 2 members of Saheliya staff to train to become digital champions. This will embed the project in the organisation & enable the staff to run additional drop-in sessions to provide practice opportunities for the learners to continue to access the equipment on an additional half day per week during the class.

### Planned project milestones

* The first class will be recruited and delivery started: December 2015
* Milestone 1 Update
* As this is a partnership project, we started the project by developing a project plan to make sure that both partners understood their role and their contribution to reaching the project milestones.
* We recruited for our first group of learners in December by holding assessments to make sure the class was the right thing for them. They started their training in January. The women have varying levels of English which has meant that we have had to develop our existing learning materials so that they were suitable for ESOL learners.  We have also developed additional learning material to meet their needs.
* The project has been a steep learning curve for everyone concerned but extremely rewarding. There will be lots to report in 'Lessons leared' by the time the project has finished. The learners are very motivated, coming in early to get extra practice and not stopping for a break.  We recruited 6 learners initially with a further 4 in the process of recruitment at the moment. 3 learners have now passed their Microsoft Basic Digital Literacy certificates and are now ready to continue at a different class to improve their Microsoft Word skills.  The other learners need slightly more time due to the language barrier but we expect them to be up to speed soon.

Our first recruits

* Recruit and train 2 volunteers to support the delivery of further training: January 2016
* We recruited 1 volunteer from Saheliya clients and a second volunteer who had already been helping with Digital Skills Academy's Use IT courses, but had experience of teaching ESOL.  Her experience is extremely useful and has allowed us to give 1-1 support to those who were finding learning more of a challenge.

* Recruit and deliver the second round of courses: April 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

**Development of basic digital literacy training will become embedded in Saheliya through the training of the digital champions.**

Result: Saheliya have now taken on board embedding digital training as part of other services offered through both wellbeing support and the learning centre (see Lessons Learned for more information).

**Volunteers will be given the opportunity to gain workplace skills and experience to add to their CVs**

Result: 3 volunteers plus training for Saheliya staff as Digital Champions was delivered. One volunteer moved on to a paid position to run digital drop-ins for all service users for Saheliya.

**36 ethnic minority women will have the skills to search for & obtain work, access public & consumer services, pay bills, search, have social contact thereby reducing discrimination & social isolation**

Result: 30 women were supported in total.  Please see Lessons Learned for more information.

**By training 2 Saheliya staff members we will leave a legacy for sustainability**

Result: 2 senior staff members will carry forward embedding digital learning within Saheliya services

### Lessons learned

**Course delivery**

Following from the first evaluation, most comments were made on the length and frequency of the course.  Initially we had thought 6 weeks at 2 half days per week would be required.  It became clear that this was not enough. The next courses ran for 8 week plus (the length linked to the learners’ ability and some stayed up to 10 weeks if this was what they needed). We also increased to 2 longer days (10.00-1.45) which still needed to allow for school children being dropped off and collected. This received more positive response in later evaluation, although some still thought not enough. However, given the resources required (trainer time, room availability and childcare) it was the maximum which could be delivered under current funding.
Also, one of the reasons several of the learners were also able to complete their courses was because of the flexibility of approach/attendance at class. The trainer led on this aspect which  allowed women to attend/complete their course to fit with their life commitments and pressures. For instance, finding space in an afternoon class when circumstances changed.  It was also important that we were able to offer classes both in the afternoon and the morning to allow this choice and flexibility too.

**Childcare**

While Saheliya had their own in-house social enterprise childcare provision, it was still a complex issue to be able to provide appropriate support within the budget.  We had originally planned for more children over a shorter course. However, what we had was less children for a longer time.  This impacted greatly on the budget.
Several issues emerged, particularly around logistics, resources and the impact on the budget:
-	Physical space available for crèche provision was an issue so the childcare centre was used. However this put pressure on their finances as the budget did not cover full costs involved.
-	Unpredictable mix of under 2 years and over 2 years meant staffing was difficult to arrange (the ages require different staff to child ratio)
-	Unpredictable attendance – for various reasons (other barriers learners face) their attendance was not always regular so a childcare space may be retained for them but they did not come to class
-	Some learners had to stay on the waiting list for a place on the course until a place became available. This is clearly not an ideal situation.

In addition, due to the short hours provided in childcare places in local nurseries, learners often had to leave class early to collect children.
The ideal situation would be to have a well-staffed crèche purely for the course. If it was fully funded the ups and downs of attendance, age of children etc would not have such a high impact.

**Language**

We knew language would be an issue and Saheliya used a learner’s ability in their ESOL class as a guide as to their readiness to take the computing class. However, it became apparent during the class that lack of confidence – whether in themselves in general or in their language skills – was a major issue.  Once they gained confidence they really excelled in the class. It was observed that some people lacked confidence and used their language skills as an excuse to hide behind.

**Topics**

The trainer would go over the different things that people could learn on the course and identify what they learner needed or wanted to learn for themselves. However, the trainer has reflected that 90% of learners, due to their background culture, wanted to do a set course with a certificate at the end rather than something tailored to their needs. Most people wanted to use the course to help them find work.

**Outcomes**

While our original target was 36 learners supported, it was felt that it was better to provide sufficient training for less individuals than stop their training leaving them with a lower level of skills than rush them through to get more individuals on the course.  Quality over quantity seemed more beneficial given the nature of the learners.
Several women have achieved outcomes way beyond our expectations, including 1 who has applied to study computing at college, 1 who got a promotion at work because she got the certificate and another who got a paid internship when they found out she had completed the course. (We will submit separate case studies for these).

**Summary**

While the course gave some of the women who attend Saheliya the opportunity to become digitally included, our final evaluation meeting brought some issues to the fore.  For example, it was felt that in order to tackle the lack of confidence issue, women who are just starting out on their wellbeing journey could benefit from digital learning being an integrated part of their support. It was felt this would prepare them to then progress onto the actual classes themselves.  This could cover every day living and civil skills such as searching for services or being able to access services they are entitled to.
Saheliya will take the idea forward of incorporating more digital learning as part of their ESOL and wellbeing classes to give women the confidence to progress to specialist digital inclusion classes.
