## Project plan

### Project description

We will utilise the network and contacts built up by the Hebridean Connections project to identify people who may benefit from training in basic digital skills. At least 20 training events will then be held throughout Lewis and Harris, with a particular emphasis on reaching out to remote rural communities.

## Project Evaluation

**Outputs and outcomes**

Since the start of the project **27 training sessions** in digital skills have been delivered to a total of **74 people**. These 74 are people who have not engaged with Hebridean Connections before. Of these sessions 10 were delivered in Uist & Barra reaching 30 people, and 17 in Uist & Harris reaching 44 people.

These sessions can be broken down into 4 different levels:

Level 1 - aimed at those who have never used a computer before

Level 2 - own or have used a computer/device but need specific advice on things such as set up

Level 3 - [Basic Digital Skills](http://digital.scvo.org.uk/participation/basic-digital-skills/) training

Level 4 - More advanced IT skills training often on particular software such as Excel or Photoshop

There have been four sessions delivered at Level 1, one at Level 2, nineteen at Level 3 and three at Level 4. Going forward the focus will be on Level 3 sessions as this is where most of the interest lies. Ongoing work will continue to be done at Level 1 as these sessions can develop an interest in using a computer and learning digital skills.

We have found that people tend to want specific advice on particular things, and that there is greater demand for smaller and 1-1 sessions. Because of this demand we are moving away from group sessions to smaller sessions and more 1-1 support. However there will still be bigger groups reached out to at Level 1 at places such as social clubs.

Of the 27 sessions 8 of them were delivered either completely or partly in Gaelic. Some of the older people are more comfortable interacting in Gaelic - there are still some senior citizens groups which are held entirely in Gaelic. It's important to have this provision as those who prefer to speak in Gaelic might be put off from learning digital skills if the sessions were only delivered in English.

Here's a picture of a local man speaking to his granddaughter for the first time on Skype during one of our training sessions:

And here's a lady who works at a local community centre being shown how to back up documents in the cloud. For people who already make some use of technology, possible loss of information can be a major worry.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has... We know this because...


**Lessons learned**

Things that worked well:

- Sessions pitched at different levels

- Increased 1-1 support

- Delivering sessions in Gaelic

Things that we would do differently next time:
