## Project plan

### Project description

Digital Skills Through Football is an education course which helps people with some interest in football – at any level – to use that interest to develop skills that are useful in both further education and the world of work.

It provides the opportunity to gain a certificate at SCQF levels 2, 3, or 4 and the level of certificate awarded depends entirely on how well the student performs over their time on the course.


## Project milestones

### Phase 1 April - May 2015

Arranging courses schedule; meeting with clubs and agreeing dates for DSTF courses.

DSTF delivered at Deveronvale FC - 3 students started course, 2 completed with 1 progressing to Stage 3 of Employability Pipeline (Work experience).

### Phase 2 June - September 2015

Delivering DSTF alongside (or training up) club community staff.

Inverness Caley Thistle community staff trained to deliver DTSF course.
ICT delivering DSTF course with 12 over 60-year-olds, first half completed in July. Second half commences in August.

Visited Hibs and Montrose FC, postive meetings with both clubs. Awaiting response to arrange training of community staff at both clubs.

A further six clubs contacted to arrange meetings, will follow up in July.

### Phase 3 October 2015 - December 2015

Delivering DSTF alongside, (or training up) club community staff

DTSF courses delivered

### Phase 4 January 2016 - March 2016

Follow up and assist DSTF students with moving into further training or employment

Students achieve outcomes after completing DSTF course


## Evaluation

### Outputs and outcomes

In terms of outcomes this project has helped 38% of unemployed students gain employment during or within 6 months of the Elgin and Deveronvale courses.

Helped 38% of unemployed students on the Elgin and Deveronvale courses move onto a higher stage of the employability pipeline (work experience).

78% of students who started the courses at Inverness and Hibernian completed the whole course, with the 11 students in Inverness achieving a level equivalent to SCQF 3 or 4 in the Core Skill Information Technology.

We know this because we tracked the students on the Elgin and Deveronvale courses by keeping in touch with them after the course had ended and supporting them in any way possible.

We were able to assess the portfolios completed by the students on the Inverness course.

In terms of outputs we delivered:

Elgin DTSF:

Starts: 5  Completions: 5  Job outcomes: 1  Stage 3 outcomes: 2

Deverondale DTSF:

Starts: 3  Completions:  2  Job outcomes:

Caley Thistle DTSF:

Starts: 12  Completions: 11

Hibernian DTSF:

Starts: 20  Completions: 14


Overall Digital Skills through Football (DTSF) has helped to improve the IT skills of 40 course participants thus far, including 25 over-60 year-olds. A further 84 school pupils are due to do the course in Kilmarnock, while Albion Rovers and Montrose will also be completing/running a DSTF course.

It has improved the lives of several young people who attended the course, helping them make steps into further training, work experience and employment.

The over-60s in particular have gained many new IT skills, including the ability to use a tablet and social media.  This makes it easier for them to keep in touch with family and friends on a regular basis, reducing isolation amongst the over-60s.
The course has also helped build relationships between the football clubs, Opportunity Enhancement Trust and their local community, allowing them to reach some students they wouldn't normally engage with.
Although the numbers on some of the courses were lower than we'd hoped, that could be boosted by the 84 school pupils due to undertake the course at Kilmarnock FC.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. Good outcomes achieved from the courses we delivered, including 3 job outcomes.
2. 90% completion rate on courses at Elgin City, Deveronvale and Caley Thistle.
3. Partnership working improved between ourselves, football clubs and referral agencies.

Things that we would do differently next time:

1.	Try and restrict the geographical spread of clubs involved to the North and North East of Scotland, the whole of Scotland was too big an area to cover.
2.	Possibly deliver one or two more of the courses ourselves? This could have made it easier for us to keep overall control of the project and be less reliant on the clubs involved.
3.	Use more tablets if possible – this has resulted in some of the courses being delayed while another club still has the tablets required. An ongoing dispute with our previous Project Manager over hardware ownership did not help this issue.
