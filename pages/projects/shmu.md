## Project plan

### Project description

Tillydrone Community Portal: The bulk of the project activities will take place from 17th August to 31st October 2015. Some of the activities will continue after the core work has been delivered in terms of supporting the installation, further roll out of the access to the portal, generation of additional content and additional evaluation.  The project will continue to be supported throughout.

**Infrastructure**

The development of the community portal is dependent on the implementation of the wireless network which is part of a different and larger project.  The timeline for the network infrastructure has slipped but is now being progressed with an anticipated installation start during w/b 21st September 2015.

**Community Engagement**

The involvement of community members in this project will help to inform and direct the activities and ensure that the portal will be developed in a user friendly manner and will contain content which is of interest to the community.  The initial activity will take the form of a stakeholder workshop with community members to share the motivations of the project, facilitate continued participation and shape the ensuing evaluation agenda. Following the initial workshop we will continue to engage with a range of community groups and organisations.


## Project milestones

### Phase 1

Initiation: Meet and engage with all key audiences

### Phase 2

Community Build Portal: Availability of community portal

### Phase 3

Engagement: Use and development of community portal

### Phase 4

Usage and functionality of community portal



## Evaluation

This project created a “community portal” template with the intention of using it as a model for the roll out of our City wide connected communities programme.  The process for creating a community portal and the technical set up for the digital gateway was piloted in one of Aberdeen’s most deprived communities.  It was anticipated that, for many, this would be their first experience of using the internet in their homes.  The project focussed on community engagement in order to build a better understanding of existing internet usage, and attitudes to the use of technology for a range of purposes.

### Outputs and outcomes

**In terms of outputs we:**

•	Delivered a community based research project which established patterns of pre-project IT usage and preferences for further work in the community [110 active participants]

•	Organised 16 community events and workshops to examine how residents perceived new technologies and what opportunities existed to integrate these into their lives.

•	Staged 12 training sessions in 4 community venues build around the benefits of using technology to enhance community life

•	Held 60 ‘drop-in’ support sessions in 4 community venues to improve competence and confidence in the use of IT

•	Produced information displays and interpretation panels as part of the community capacity building

•	Designed a digital gateway for the community portal which supported the authentication required to access the community based WiFi network


**In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has:**

•	Generated a baseline understanding of existing internet connectivity and usage within the Tillydrone community [it is considered that there are similarities with other communities within which we work]

•	Increased trust between residents, community organisations and service providers

•	Improved awareness of best practice for future and further community engagement

•	Increased understanding of the future uses to which technological solutions could be applied

•	Increased the capability of local people to access and make productive use of the internet

•	Increased the skill and competence level of community members in relation the use of computer equipment [desktop, laptop, tablet & mobile devices] and a range of computer applications

•	Increased the number of residents in the Tillydrone community making regular access to the internet

•	Increased the purposes for which residents access the internet

### Lessons learned

**Things that worked well:**

1. Community engagement.  Station House Media Unit has many years’ experience of undertaking community engagement.  The sessions undertaken were well received and significantly increased the understanding of the project and built trust between the community and the range of service delivery agents, especially the University of Aberdeen and Aberdeen City Council
2. The level of engagement.  Given a relatively low level of pre-project experience of the internet there was a high level of involvement with the programmed activities from the base-line research to the training activities.


**Things that we would do differently next time:**

1. Do not make assumptions.  Based on the socio-demographic make-up of the community we made some pre-project assumptions about the base-line level of knowledge and understanding and base-line level of internet usage.  This created some difficulty in the early public consultation sessions.  The base-line research proved to be an extremely useful exercise and generated some surprising results and this ought to have been completed prior to undertaking any logistical planning.
2. Too many ‘partners’.  There were a number of parallel projects running concurrently and there was a perception, in the community, that the projects were all linked.  There was some time slippage on some of the projects, such as the installation of the public Wi-Fi network.  This also created some friction in the community.  In retrospect it would have been desirable to have kept this project as a very discrete element and ensured that the objectives and intentions were made absolutely clear to the community.
