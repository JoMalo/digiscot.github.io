### Project description
We believe elderly people will go online or will agree to be trained to go online when they have a compelling reason. We intend to use ’being connected to the culture events of the town’ to be that compelling reason, from which the training will open the door to the rest of the benefits on digital access. The Training will be classroom based in the Tower's new Apple Training centre. The Tower has established (with the help of Apple) an Apple authorised education training centre. The centre has 10 new 5k mac’s and 4k monitor in the training room, the building has a Gigabit fibre internet connection, (which was installed to receive and send streamed connect and is paid for by sponsors) which will be used throughout the training. The Training centre has a manager and several volunteers who will be running the Silverscreen training. The course will be a series of four 3 hour sessions which take the participants through the basics of understanding the computer, how the internet works, email (how to use it securely), using Google to find things, using Facebook to connect with community, and finding out what's going on. The goals will be for all participants to be able after 4 sessions to be able to receive emails (about what's happening in the town and at the Tower in particular - which we know will be of interest), to be able to connect and engage with a social network (Facebook) and to be able to do a transaction online should they wish to. While the more adept of the participants will need less time than the course's 12 hours provided, a significant number will need all of the time planned.


### Planned project milestones

* First set of series of 12 training sessions will be completed (having commenced end of November): January 2016

* Second set of series of 12 training sessions will be completed: February 2016

* Third set of series of 12 training sessions will be completed: March 2016

* Fourth set of series of 12 training sessions will be completed: April 2016


### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Over 120 elder people in Helensburgh will be digital enabled allowing them to manage information, communicate, transact, participate and create online thus transforming their daily lives and their involvement in the local community.

* The Tower will continue to operate SilverScreen Training in the future.

* We will create a handful of digital evangelists from the first series who will be coached to blog and encouraged to participate in other courses at the Apple training centre (film making, script writing, editing etc..)
