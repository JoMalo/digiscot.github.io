## Project plan

### Project description

The project will support a six month Digital Internship post which will create a mentored online learning resource for frontline staff working with client groups least likely to have basic digital skills and access. The content is based on the ’23 Things’ approach originally developed for Information Professionals and more recently adopted by the Scottish Government Library as a digital learning approach for civil servants.


## Project milestones

26/06/15
Initial outline of the project plan created detailing the range of learning covered by the online resource. This covers awareness of Social Media platforms, awareness and use of blogs, online collaboration tools, alerts and awareness tools, searching skills, social media content plans and introducing users to new hardware (Smart boards, tablets, e-readers). A presentation with key members of the target audience from Glasgow Communities and Glasgow Libraries frontline staff was arranged to discuss and agree upon the outlined content of the resource.

10/06/15
Targeted programme of support agreed with Moore Legal Tech and Glasgow Kelvin College covering Social Media Marketing & Optimisation, Web design, Content Writing & Optimisation and digital learning delivery platforms such as Moodle. This will aid the creation of the online learning resource, and will determine the finalised platform.

28/08/15
Digital learning resource created and in place for initial frontline staff use. This is the date set out for the completion of the first instance of the digital online learning resource. At this stage the selected frontline staff members would be given access to use the resource and to begin the course.

21/09/2015
Review of the project at the halfway stage and how the project is progressing against milestone markers. Report back to SCVO on the progress of the project at this stage and update project webpage.

05/10/2015
Review of the initial resource created, establish strengths and weaknesses in the programme and identify areas that need changed or removed to improve it. This will be done through getting the input from members of the frontline staff using the tools. This will be done using an online evaluation to receive the most honest results from participants.

26/10/15
Arrange handover of course management procedures, learning materials. A programme management and development plan with clear timescales and responsibilities will be agreed and implemented.

09/11/2015
Structure, approach, materials, lessons learned and next steps are agreed, packaged and shared with SCVO and local partners. Best practice and materials are shared both locally and nationally.

27/11/15
Project review and evaluation. Final assessment and evaluation of the project, report back to the SCVO, update the project page to reflect final outcomes and share learning with local partners. Lastly, agree final steps in the programme developments.

## Project Progress

As of the 17/08/15, the Glasgow Life Moodle has been implemented and the course content has began to be moved accross to this platform. The initial expectation that the resource would be able to be piloted by the 28/08/15 has been reconsidered, as the content has been expanded to cover a wider range of topic areas. All content is expected to be on the resource by the 04/09/15, at this stage it will be evaluated by Glasgow Life's Digital Tutors. Once this inital evaluation has taken place the project will be piloted with users. Adding in this extra set of inital evaluations that was not previously considered will help in establishing any areas of the resource that need furhter work before it is given to frontline staff.

Glasgow Kelvin College is providing members of staff to aid in the initial set up of the Moodle. They are providing help with the Moodle platform and how best to use this educational tool, as well as allowing us to host the Glasgow Life Moodle on their servers.

To reflect the change to the completion date of the Moodle and taking into consideration the extra evaluation process that is being used the dates of all project milestones have been moved forward two weeks. This still allows for project completion within the six month timeframe.


## Evaluation

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project delivered a range of mentored digital CPD learning resource for a wide range of frontline staff (Youth, Community, Play workers, ESOL and ALN tutors). The content was based on the ’23 Things’ approach originally developed for Information Professionals and more recently adopted by the Scottish Government Library as a digital learning approach for civil servants.

In terms of outputs we have to date delivered training for 40 frontline workers. The training materials are currently being reviewed and expanded following feedback from the first tranche of trainees and will commence again in Autumn 2016 after a workforce rationalisation process has concluded.

An online (Moodle based – in partnership with Glasgow Kelvin College) learning resource which will continue to develop and expand.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has ensured that our frontline staff have the skills and knowledge to weave relevant digital learning elements into the work they are already doing with harder to reach groups – exposing these learners (often for the first time) to the advantages and learning resources available online.

We know this because the feedback from staff who have completed the training has indicated greater confidence in using a wide range of online learning materials and opportunities in their day-to-day work. We have also noted a much higher demand for hardware (tablet/laptops/ projectors etc) and better connectivity in community venues.


### Lessons learned

**Things that worked well:**

1. Connecting the intern with relevant digital mentors at the very start of the project, this ensured a better end product as well as developing the skills (and work contacts) of our intern.

2. Adopting the ’23 Things’ approach which ensures staff can learn the skills which are most important to their situation and clients in a flexible way, without the need to bring staff from across the city together for a more traditional approach. Staff also appreciated being able to work through the materials at their own pace with help and feedback where required.

3. Our partnership with Kelvin College – using an established and proven digital learning platform

**Things that we would do differently next time:**

1. More testing of the learning materials before launch (can you ever have too much?).

2. Involved the learning administrator (of the Moodle system) at an earlier stage, particularly in how the learning ‘bites’ are presented and described.

3. Not presume that our frontline staff already have good basic digital skills – a minority of staff required a more remedial approach.
