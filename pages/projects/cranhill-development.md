## Project plan

### Project description

Cranhill Development Trust will be working in partnership with the Wheatley Group and Glasgow Kelvin College to install a Click and Connect Lite Learning Centre in Ruchazie Parish Church. Once installed we will then deliver Digital Work Club sessions for a total of nine hours per week, delivered by an Employability Worker and supported by volunteers to enable the community and its members to increase confidence, digital skills, offer volunteering opportunities and support people to move closer to or into employment.



## Project milestones



## Evaluation

Upon installation of our Click and Connect Lite Learning Centre in Ruchazie Parish Church in July 2015 we then launched our Digital Work Clubs at Ruchazie. The Digital Work Clubs were one day per week followed by the introduction of further learning and training provision that was made available. The Click and Connect Learning Centre was supported by Digital volunteers who were identified through their involvement in the local community allowing further support to people who were dropping into the learning centre, overall 160 users received free access to the learning centre.

### Outputs and outcomes

**In terms of outputs we delivered:**

36 Digital Work Clubs, 66 people participated

12 Digital Skills Classes, 9 people participated

1 Employability Skills Class “Let’s get that job”, 6 people participated

1 Employability Sector Specific Training Food Hygiene, 10 people participated

Finance Budgeting, 4 people participated

Digital Volunteers, 5 people participated

Café Volunteers at Ruchazie Parish Church, 3 people participated

Employment Outcomes, 11 people gained employment

Achieved Qualification, 19 people achieved


**In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about this project has:**

Increased confidence and digital skills of local people

Improved employability chances

Increased number of people participating in volunteer opportunities

Reduction in number of people unemployed

We know this because we review and monitor all data captured, have a registration and assessment process in place and record attendance for all activities. We gather feedback and case studies on an ongoing basis.

### Lessons learned

**Things that worked well:**

1. Bringing further training and learning provision into the Ruchazie community allowed people easy access. People in Ruchazie could also access training and learning at Cranhill site.
2. Volunteer support from local people encouraged others to get involved.
3. The venue having an open community space and café were people can drop in.

**Things that we would do differently next time:**

1.	Plan more staff resource over a longer timescale
2.	Work on marketing strategy (in progress)
3.	More realistic timescale of when install taking place
