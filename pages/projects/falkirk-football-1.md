### Project description

Falkirk Football Community Foundation will utilise the passion for Falkirk Football Club that exists in the community to deliver an innovative programme. The programme will increase people’s basic digital skills and, through practical activities, give them the confidence to use the skills.

We will initially target people who have an interest in the football club to participate in the programme. Prior to starting we will survey the potential participants to ensure they need the level of course we are delivering. We will use the attraction of the club and the opportunity to meet players and manager as a draw for the programme. To maintain their interest we will structure the programme and specific activities around the club, researching, writing about and other tasks associated with the club to provide relevance to the individuals and to use their digital skills.

We will deliver three programmes of 10 weeks ea the opportunity to work in partnership with the Club and Foundation to develop regular online content. This will include a newsletter, press releases, web articles, facebook updates and twitter feeds. In this way they will be able practice their skills in a positive environment promoting an activity and organisation they already support. This will use the different skills they during each week’s 3 hour session, homework and an additional hours supported access provided by FFCF free of charge.

We will use our experience in delivering community and employability programmes to increase participant’s self-confidence and self-esteem alongside their practical skills. Barriers for older people getting online are likely to include the basic digital skills but more importantly the confidence to learn and put into practice new skills. We will gently develop this confidence and encourage a growth mindset in participants, so that they can learn from the course and then continue to develop their skills.

We will use the attraction of football to deliver an innovative programme that engages people, provides a purpose to learn digital skills and the confidence to use those skills in their everyday lives.


### Planned project milestones

* We will have developed the programme plan, have outline programme content and be ready to deliver the course. In addition we will have met partners to advertise the programme to participants, have developed marketing material and distributed it to partners. Bookings for places will be open: December 2015

* First programme starts; we will have recruited 10 appropriate individuals and start the programme: January 2016

* First Programme completed; we will have completed the first programme, collected evaluation information and developed further information for planning the next course: March 2016

* Remainder of the programme will be planned; through the evaluation we will have planned the following two programmes, including dates, content, methods and other details required. Volunteers will be recruited to support the programme.

* The programme will be complete; we will have delivered and evaluated three programmes. We will have learnt from each programme, developed a pool of volunteers to assist in delivery and will be researching other funding to continue delivery.

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* 25 people will complete the British Computer Society Computer and Online Basics course successfully

* Each participant will show Increased confidence in digital skills

* Each participant will have Increased self-esteem and positive current thoughts

* Digital Content regarding Falkirk Football Community Foundation and Falkirk Football Club will be regularly developed by course participants


### Evaluation

All of the participants in each of the three cohorts thoroughly enjoyed attending the Stadium and collaborating with like-minded people who shared similar ability levels and frustrations as themselves.

With almost half of the pre-programme Digital Skills questionnaires providing responses of *"I have no idea what you're talking about"* this confirmed that not only were we attracting the correct individuals onto the course, but also demonstrated that the improvements made were significant.   

At the end of the courses, some of the participants were now able to share online photos with their relatives for the first time. They were also enabled by their new found digital skills to maintain a level of contact with relatives via email. In fact, some were even able to use online services to create birthday cards for family members!

**One participant, who was a keen photographer, is now able to start cataloguing his photos and creating slideshows for relatives to view and share online!**

On the whole and as a result of the programme, all of the groups are now able to create, input and manipulate text and photos within their documents.

## Outcomes and Outputs

### Lessons learned

**What worked well?**

The programme went well from start to finish. All of the participants were willing and keen to learn. They embraced the group setting and peer learning environment we created, due to the fact that they were mostly all at the same starting point re: their digital skills understanding. This group setting meant that they could learn as a "team" from successes and disappointments, whilst looking for solutions together.

During the web search activity, one or two of the group started to research holidays and were comparing prices online. By the end of the programme, they were at the stage of booking their next holiday online!

**What would you do differently?**

We would improve our marketing strategy re: clarification of course content and would provide additional time outwith the programme to offer support for smart phone and tablet usage.

Although everyone securing a place was informed that this was not a course purely for smart phones or tablets, a few people turned up with the sole motivation of receiving 1-2-1 support with their own device. Although most do possess one of these devices and would benefit from increased knowledge in how to use them, our course content required use of a laptop and associated software. Perhaps next time we could use the free aftercare service to provide this assistance if required.
