### Project description

We are proposing to have a Drop-in sessions on Wednesday afternoons in the Lewis Retirement Centre where individuals or members of the various over 60s clubs can bring along their own equipment and be taught the basics of how to use it to keep in touch with friends and family.

Tea and biscuits on tap throughout the afternoon. The Centre is wheelchair accessible and has its own off road parking. The Drop-in sessions will be run by the Stormoway Old Peoples Welfare Association with some support from Cabraich. Fibre broadband will be available free. This is an innovative project because all other courses locally want to teach IT, not how to use an individual’s personal cell phone, ipad or whatever they use.

### Planned project milestones

* Start of the Drop-in Tea & Technology sessions. Please note that the number of people supported may be much higher as the Drop-in develops but this cannot be forecast accurately: December 2015

* Instructing on Christmas gifts of technology: January 2016

* Project completion and evaluation: February 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* To help the over 60s to feel comfortable with their technology and to reduce or even eliminate the fear that is engendered when faced with ’new’ systems

* To help the over 60s to keep in touch with friends and family by using modern technology

* To make the learning a social occasion where the clients can mix with their peers in a warm and comfortable environment

* Providing reassurance to younger relatives that their seniors know how to use technology to summon help when needed
