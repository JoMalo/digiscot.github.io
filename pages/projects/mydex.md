## Project plan

### Project description

STRiVE the Third Sector Interface (TSI) in East Lothian in partnership with Mydex and SCVO will create through the salesforce platform a sharing protocol to link our individual volunteers and clients and create personal data stores (PDS) for initial 200 - 400 users. This will create personal data stores to allow users to give permission to any service to access their data through a sharing protocol which they control, with the advantage of never having to duplicate information or repeat to any other service they require.


## Project milestones

### Phase 1

Mydex CIC meet STRiVE team members Introductions with key participants Mydex CIC prepare and send Salesforce Connection to Mydex platform documentation.

### Phase 2

Meet STRiVE staff in Musselburgh and STRiVE prepare inputs to Connection Plan Define what transactions are going to exchange data between a PDS and the Salesforce system Define customers (citizens/staff etc).

### Phase 3

Connection from Salesforce to Mydex platform on sandbox.
STRiVE and SCVO test with team on sandbox and agree and enable fields to share digital information and create personal data stores for each individual volunteer and client. STRiVE staff will then with client permission recruit users and enable data exchange between STRiVE Salesforce and citizensâ€™ PDS via the Mydex platform.

**Update July 2016:**

Agree fields of data for trial in sandbox to manage transfer to create new personal data stores. Test system, data transfer and on completion start live data transfer.

## Evaluation

Review of uptake of data stores and review of value of data sharing with collective services across wellbeing services in Third Sector, GP surgeries and NHS and social care settings.

Individual evaluations on use of accounts and ability to easily and in a controlled fashion share data to stop duplication.

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project is designed to put people in charge of their own data, allowing a person centered approach, putting the citizen rather than the agency in charge.
