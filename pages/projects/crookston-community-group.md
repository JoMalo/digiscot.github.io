### Project description

The project will provide a platform for females from the Black and ethnic minority communities to come together in a spirit of community and learning to access basic IT skills (our aim is to have a sustainable project and as such in year two we aim to additionally offer an intermediate IT course). Given that many of our service users have never used a desk top a laptop or a tablet, it is necessary to first make individuals familiar with the hardware and allow them to feel comfortable around the equipment. It is vital to create a comfortable environment where individuals are not only attending to learn but attending to make friends and contacts who will become their external support networks. Support networks can prove vital in helping to support and encourage the educational progression of individuals and can lead to enhanced computer literacy skills, as often individuals will take their learning home, share their learning and therefore independently expand their learning.

By virtue of the project individuals will learn the skills to set up social network accounts and thereby stay in touch with family and friends via Skype, Facebook, Twitter and others. Through our other projects we have learnt that some of our female service users who, for example have had to leave their loved ones behind and seek refuge or asylum in this country, often are devoid of any support whether that be financial or otherwise and as such may not have access to resources which enables them to stay in touch with their loved ones. This adds to their sense of isolation and exclusion in a country in which they know and have very little and this can and does can affect their mental and physical health. Therefore, the ability to connect with loved ones not only breaks their sense of isolation/exclusion but can help improve their physical and mental well being which is essential to their effective integration in societal life and in them exercising active citizenship.

Participants will learn to surf the net, to access educational websites; health websites; to type in and learn of what is happening locally so they can attend events and meet people. Additionally individuals will be encouraged and supported in making online applications for i.e. benefits; colleges; employment opportunities. They will be introduced to Microsoft word and will be taught how to write a document- save a document and print a document etc.

Emails are an instant and effective way of communication and participants will be assisted in creating email accounts, managing emails and will be encouraged to regularly email other participants to the project in order to build their confidence in communicating in this way.

Through the project our aim is not only to provide and develop Digital skills and experiences but itâ€™s also to encourage excluded individuals and communities to access and benefit from educational, employment and training opportunities that will help break their sense of isolation and exclusion.

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* The key achievement will be the increased digital participation and engagement of females from the Black and ethnic cultural communities that will result in them developing enhanced computer literacy skills. This is important considering these individuals may not otherwise have access to the resources which will be made possible and available through the project.
* 50 disadvantaged females will have learnt and developed their IT skills
* Participants will be using emails and social media as an effective means of communication to stay connected with family and friends
* IT skills will be transferred to family members and friends


### Evaluation

Overall,  this project was successful and achieved the aims as set out in the original application. Over the course of a year, we have engaged 30 females into using IT , females whom had very little experience of using a PC and were lacking confidence. In particular, a majority of these women came from black and minority ethnic backgrounds.

The Women Want Wifi programme has helped them with a variety of  computer, laptop and tablet skills such as using Microsoft and social media platforms.

The class ran twice per week for people who were unable able to attend on a specific designated day. Ultimately, we have helped females with the basic skills of every day use of Microsoft software programmes, email and social media for keeping in touch with family and friends as well as making online enquiries.  

With regards to outputs, we delivered a basic IT skills based course and activities that included using their laptop, tablets/smartphones, to navigate their way around a computer system and the internet.

In terms of outcomes, feedback questionnaires at the end of the programme, showed that  the group this project has assisted, helped them gain confidence in using technologies in a safe environment where no questions were left unaddressed and help was at hand whenever required. This was evident through weekly attendance and differing questions that were asked to support their own personal stages of IT knowledge.

There were some limitations to the programme, not in terms of delivery, but in terms of facilities. We found that we had limited equipment to deal with the demand of females wishing to use our services, often resulting in a backlog of individuals wishing to use the service.

In total we have supported 30 people. Out of this figure, 9 participants have walked away with communication skills by communicating online with their families and friends using social media platforms. 2 participants learned how to make transactions online (banking, shopping etc), this low number is the reason we seek to deliver another programme aimed at educating partipants about the digital onine world, where they can shop and bank. 27 partipants now hold problem solving skills and can comfortably navigate their way around a computer system. 16 particpants learned how to create content online using facebook for status updates, pictures, album and instagram for images and editing those images. 28 participants can now manage information on systems using microsoft word for documents, as well as using Evernote and OneNote for storing notes.


### Lessons learned

Through feedback from the community as well as the programme service users and the success of the Women Want Wifi Programme, it has collectively been expressed by service users that the service should not just be limited to women, they should also include men. Often, male CCG service users have voiced this when on the premises.

They wish to expand on their current knowledge to adapt to the current digital age. They now seek to learn how to use technologies to conduct every day transactions such as online shopping and online banking. Also, they have voiced their interest in learning how to make full use of mobile phone technologies etc and this is something the CCG will now look to in the future.

This of course, would not have been discovered if it was not the the funded Women Want Wifi programme.
