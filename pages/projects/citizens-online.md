## Project plan

### Project description

Through the funds from the awesome SCVO Challenge Fund, we aim to embed Highland Regional activity through the following work plan:

* Ongoing liaison with HIE Digital Highlands and Islands Programme

* Regional co-ordination of Highlands and Islands activity

* Coordination of digital inclusion activity in NGB areas (where accessible public venues exist)

* Developing new project briefs

* Training and development

* Facilitating participation in national objectives – such as the Digital Participation Charter

* Reporting and measures in line with local funding direction

* Extending partnerships at a regional/national level

Skills Sessions: We will offer tutor led skills sessions throughout the Highlands and Islands and tie in to local ABE/FE/HE networks as well as open and online learning opportunities. Our learning opportunities will be aimed at those getting online for the first time, and we will signpost to further learning online. (Let’s Get on through Education and Training)

Inspiring Digital in our Communities/Engaging new community groups: We will continue to build and expand our network of community groups; offer and deliver Inspiring Digital sessions to our network to open up new approaches to digital at a community level. This activity will increase community capacity at a grassroots level, and build a legacy of sustainablity through embedding new
skills. We will also work to identify key local & national stakeholders and submitting funding proposals. (Let’s Get on in our communities)

Inspiring Digital in the Workplace : We will offer informal Inspiring Digital workplace learning opportunities with appropriate partners throughout the region, again increasing capacity and ability in frontline staff. These sessions will look at encouraging staff to develop their own digital skills. Furthermore, we will workwith those partners offering digital public services and offer best practice support through the highlighting the potential for implementation of our systemic approach. (Let’s Get on at work/ Lets Get on with Digital Public Services)

Train the Trainer: We will continue to develop our Train the Trainer activity throughout the region with local partners and community groups, modelling best practice in digital inclusion practices and supporting independent delivery. This underpins both capacity building and sustainability at a local level. (Let’s Get on at home/Let’s Get on in our Communities)

Supporting the rollout: As a team, we will actively engage those communities benefitting from NGB or Community Broadband development. (Let’s Get on through Connectivity)

Building a national movement: We will ensure that activity in the region relates to national priorities, widen the geographical spread of activity in the Highlands and Islands region; share best practice and champion our success. We will highlight the benefits and opportunities of the Digital Charter, contribute to SCVO and Scottish Government led events, contribute to the Let’s Get On database, and highlight the successes and strengths of Our Digital Zone digital inclusion activity at a national level.


## Project milestones
May 2015
The project has got off to a flying start: our crack team in the Highlands and Islands has regrouped and we've been planning a brilliant stretch of inclusion digital inclusion activity across the most beautiful areas of Scotland. Our team consists of the brillliant Brigitte Vallance in Badenoch and Strathspey, the stupendous Shona in Caithness and Sutherland, the totally terrific Tracey in Shetland and then the three joyous J's: Judie in the Inner Moray Firth, Janette in Orkney and Jo in Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh.

We have agreed our marketing with our ever patient and supportive funding partners - as well as the funds we receive from SCVO through the Challenge Fund, we are also incredibly lucky to receive further financial support from Highlands and Islands Enterprise as part of their wider digital participation agenda. We've been careful in creating our posters to use shared language around digital inclusion, working together with partners to promote activity in a way that is recognised not only to be effective but also that creates the positive and empowering message of participation.

Our newly branded PowerPoint slides got their first airing at the DigiScotFest in the Western Isles, where we travelled to meet a range of partners and discuss our plans for the coming months ahead, meeting with our Challenge Fund buddies, the fantastic [Hebridean Connections](http://www.hebrideanconnections.com/)

But most importantly, we have our first sessions up and running! Classes and sessions started this month, and are detailed on HIE's website [here](http://www.hie.co.uk/about-hie/events/)

Over the coming months, we hope to pull together some fab case studies and wee videos to share with you.
