## Project plan

### Project description

The church recognises the importance of having access to a computer in this digital age. Not only do having computer skills improve job prospects, but are also valuable when searching for jobs, courses or volunteering opportunities. Accessing welfare information and making benefit application is increasingly done on-line. Volunteer staff at the learning centre can help with welfare issues, benefits and sanctions. The learning centre seeks to empower those who feel isolated due to a lack of ITC skills and internet access. Five laptop computers are available for anyone in the community to use. The centre is currently opened twice a week and gives individuals the opportunity to work at their own level and pace in a relaxed atmosphere. Volunteers can help to write a CV, look for work or provide one to one guidance through a certificated computer course.

Oasis Learning Centre is open to all, drop in at any time between:
Monday 2.30pm - 4.30pm
Thursday 10.00am - 12.00pm
