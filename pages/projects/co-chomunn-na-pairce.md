## Project plan

### Project description

Building on our role as a community hub we will offer drop-in training sessions. We will research the specific needs in the area using our shop as a place to meet people and raise the profile of the service as well as advertising through other community groups. A questionnaire will facilitate the process. We will offer drop-in sessions in the Centre led by a familiar face from Ravenspoint. Our aim is that 30 people will benefit from the sessions which will be short, focused and flexible and, depending on demand will be 1 + 1 or in small groups.


## Project milestones

**May**

Pre-training participant research.

**August**

Deliver training and recieving and recording feedback from participants.

Mid-way review.

**December**

Training completed, overall feedback will be reviewed. Information on any additional training needs will be compiled with a view to linking participants to other services, to help them continue their training if desired.


## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project delivered basic digital skills training to 6 people. Unfortunately take-up overall was variable. One large group had planned to use our sessions but decided for convenience to go to sessions in a more central location. Some individuals wanted more than one session and we provided this. We know of others who still want to be trained and we have decided, based on our experience with the scheme, to offer sessions at our centre in the future. The experience we gained with the scheme has shown us that this can be done as part of our regular work as a community hub, with training provided by volunteers.
