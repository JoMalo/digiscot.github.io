## Project plan

### Project description

The Youth Achievement and Dynamic Youth Awards group will provide 2 x 10 sessions (20) of beginner internet training and light touch support for older people in their area. They will provide equipment for learners to use. The sessions will be held both in the local community centre and by visiting older peoples homes.

The Bridging the Gap project is being led by Gemma Gunn and Janette Mackie.

## Project milestones

So far the group have had 8 training sessions on learning how to use/teach others to use ipads etc.

We had our 1st outreach session at St Peters (residential home) on Tues 11th August.

We have 3 more planning/preparation sessions, starting 20 August, before we start the sessions open to the public in the Community Centre.



## Evaluation

This is where the project lead will share information about what was achieved and what was learned.

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project was a great success. Evaluations were all very positive. Everyone that attended said they would recommend the group to friends and family and would return for follow up sessions.

In terms of outputs we ensured an informal and relaxed work style that the trainees were comfortable with. We encouraged trainees to use iPads themselves more than the young leaders showing them everything.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has given the trainees more confidence in using modern technology and taught trainees about a wider world of technology and recourses available to them. We know this because it was reflected in the evaluations and feedback.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. Providing tea, coffee and cakes
2. Young people being previously trained in how to deliver training to older people
3. Having the same trainees attending - young people got to know them

Things that we would do differently next time:

1. Have more one to one sessions for older people who are more hard of hearing as being in a group sometimes confused them
