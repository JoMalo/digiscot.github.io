## Project plan

### Project description

To recruit a part time Volunteer Coordinator to oversee the delivery of a Volunteer Digital Champions programme for the Smart Communities Project. This will allow us to develop a new strand which will encourage the sharing of knowledge and provide valuable experience and relevant qualifications for volunteers, enhancing their opportunities for employment and increasing our capacity to positively affect change for people living in our communities. The outcomes of the project are to recruit 30 Volunteer Digital Champions across the 5 communities with the aim of each volunteer assisting 2 local people to help them develop their digital skills and access. This will be achieved with the support of the Volunteer Coordinator who will ensure the recruitment, opportunity, support and accreditation for each volunteer in partnership with Glasgow Kelvin College.


## Project milestones

We have recruited a Volunteer Co-Ordinator, Simon, to help us to expand and improve our Digital Champions Program. Simon has an IT background and has worked on a Digital Inclusion project in the past. Simon is due to start at the beginning of June and will be key for the project’s recruitment and training of Digital Champions.

We have also identified members of the community who currently volunteer at our events who would be ideal candidates to complete the Digital Champion Training.

One of our volunteers, Jane, helps out at our weekly Drop-In sessions in Calton. Jane usually supports people who are job-searching, especially helping with creating and editing CVs, uploading and attaching CVs, and email correspondence with possible employers.

The second volunteer, Frank, is from an IT background and uses his considerable experience to help run our monthly CoderDojo session in Castlemilk. We work in partnership with CoderDojo Scotland to provide a local coding club to children aged 8-11 in the Castlemilk area. This is intended to help young people in the area access the opportunity to learn more about coding (computer programming) in their local community. A number of CoderDojo volunteers from across the central belt help to run the session, and Frank is a local resident who offered to lend his services to the project.

Claire, another volunteer, has also helped out at a Drop-In session based in Tureen Street, at the heart of a Retirement Housing community. This session tends to be attended by older people from the community who are interested in getting to grips with the basics of IT.

We also have a number of local people who are interested in becoming Digital Champion volunteers and an existing Digital Champion to help support our new volunteers. These volunteers will help us to provide new and additional services to the communities we work in.

## Evaluation

We have found that most volunteers we have recruited have been previous participants with Smart Communities, meaning they had very basic or no knowledge of using digital technology. As such the volunteers required a much higher level of support than we initially anticipated to reach the appropriate level of confidence and skill to support other people.

Several of these volunteers also have additional support needs ranging from alcohol and drug dependencies or literacy and language barriers, to lack of confidence and self-esteem. As a result of this, the volunteers have been given more one-to-one support from the Digital Inclusion Assistant in order to build their self-esteem and capacity and allow them to feel confident in supporting other learners. Some volunteers also have complex personal circumstances, and other commitments which means they may not be able to complete the Digital Champion training in the time frame we initially expected (eg. approximately over 8 weeks or so).
We have also had several volunteers who have done very well, and as such have moved on to work, or education and as such could not continue volunteering with us.

For example, Jane, who had been helping out at our weekly Drop-In sessions in Calton, has moved on to full time work as a shop manager. Volunteers James and David, who had also been involved in sessions in the Calton area have also moved on to full time work. Despite not completing the Certificate in Digital Inclusion, all of our Digital Champions who have moved on to employment have provided feedback to us that the experience of volunteering was interesting and fulfilling and was also something they could add to their CV and to speak about at interview, thus helping them to get back into employment, in some cases after a long period of unemployment.

Claire, another volunteer, started attending University to study Community Development in September. Whilst Claire enjoyed volunteering, the time constraints of her university course has meant she has been unable to continue volunteering with us in 2016. Claire completed the Certificate in Digital Inclusion before moving on and has stated that her volunteering experience has helped her to gain insight into working in communities, which will help her in future studies in Community Development.


### Outputs and outcomes

Overall, we have recruited a volunteer co-ordinator in order to support our volunteering programme. This has allowed us to develop a new strand for the project which encourages the sharing of knowledge and has provided valuable experience and relevant qualifications for volunteers. This, in turn has enhanced their opportunities for employment and has also increased our project’s capacity to positively affect change for people living in our communities.

In terms of outputs, since June 2015, 20 participants out of the agreed 30 have signed up as volunteer Digital Champions. 10 of these are Thenue staff members. As Thenue is a Digital Participation Charter Signatory, Thenue has committed to allowing staff to have the opportunity to engage with digital activity/training, and as such will be allowed to spend  2% of their working hours each month volunteering to support the project. The reason for this has been in order to provide more in-depth support for the volunteers who are past participants of the project, whose needs are greater than we initially expected. Staff volunteers complement our other volunteers, as staff members require less intense support from the Volunteer Co-ordinator. This also fosters positive relationships between staff and local people, outwith the more formal housing office environment. Since June, our volunteers have helped to support over 50 drop-in sessions and coding sessions, which have involved over 70 adults and young people as participants, across our communities.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has provided supportive volunteering opportunities for a range of people, with varied experiences and backgrounds and has supported them to build confidence, increase their digital skill level, increase their participation in their own local community and also improved their employability skills.

We know this because our volunteers have been well-retained, having only moved on because they have accessed other employment or education opportunities. Our volunteers have fed back to us that they feel supported, that they have learned new things, and that they feel more confident in supporting others, and also in themselves more generally.  Many of our volunteers have other commitments and complex needs, and so we have adopted a more flexible, inclusive model which allows volunteers with a range of needs to engage with the project, to access the specific support that they need, and to work at their own pace, at a level that suits them.

Graham is a participant who has engaged with the project and has recently taken up the opportunity to become a Volunteer Digital Champion. Graham has said:

“The project has helped me become more confident which has helped me make new friends. It has broken my isolation of being in the house all the time and got me out through the week. Being involved in the project has given me more confidence using a computer because before I had never used one because I was scared of them. I am a great listener and have respect for other people and enjoy using these skills as part of my volunteering. I have a good understanding of where people are coming from and know how hard it can be to ask for help so I am looking forward to making people feel comfortable and helping them learn new digital skills as part of a friendly group.”

We have also been able to offer additional training opportunities to our volunteers due to Thenue’s expanded volunteering project (funded via Thenue’s employability project Learning Works), which provides a range of volunteering and learning opportunities in addition to the Digital Champion role and training, and can also refer volunteers onto other specialist agencies and volunteering placements which suit their individual needs.

Furthermore, the advancement of many of our volunteers onto employment, other training or education, in itself provides evidence of increased employability, and our volunteers have noted the usefulness of their volunteering role and training in helping them to complete application forms/CVs and to successfully complete their interviews.


### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

We built positive relationships with all of our volunteers, and all our volunteers felt supported in their training and in delivering support to others.

We adapted our delivery of the volunteering training, and provided additional support to those who needed it, which allowed us to continue to work with individuals who otherwise may not have been able to continue volunteering.
The training and experience of volunteering has allowed many of our volunteers to move on into additional training, education and employment, demonstrating that the training and the role of Digital Champion is helpful in building both skills attainment (i.e. via formal training and accreditation) and also soft skills such as communication and confidence.

Things that we would do differently next time:

We initially underestimated the levels of support required by some volunteers to not only feel competent at giving Digital support, but also to feel confident about delivering that support to other people in their communities. We have realised that we will need to recruit volunteers from a range of sources, including individuals who already have many of the skills and experiences necessary to fulfil the role of Digital Champion. Indeed, we have begun recruiting additional volunteers through our Volunteering Programme, in the hope that more peer-to-peer support can be provided by volunteers, in addition to the support and training provided by the Smart Communities’ staff. The addition of Thenue Staff members as volunteers will also support this model, where volunteers can learn from each other, and provide support for each other as part of their role as Digital Champion. This would allow the Smart Communities project to support additional volunteers, as well as participants, and would foster a positive learning and volunteering environment which encourages interaction and skills-sharing between staff, volunteers and participants.

We have also expanded our own ideas of what should be involved in volunteering training. Originally, our training focused mainly on skills attainment (e.g. having the basic IT skills required to complete digital activities) and some softer skills (e.g. communication with participants, making people feel at ease, treating others respectfully). However, we have now witnessed the importance of confidence and self-esteem building in supporting our volunteers, and so would like to incorporate this into our training on a more formal basis in future. This is particularly important for more vulnerable volunteers, but will be of benefit to all.
