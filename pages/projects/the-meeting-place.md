### Project description

We will be taking digital inclusion in an additional direction using iPads and enabling our current learners at the project plus at least 18 others over 2 sessions. Apart from all the educational interactive apps that we have already become aware of during a planning meeting with COL, it has opened up our creative and inclusive thinking to learn more about not only apps but how this smaller portable device can have positive social, educational and health benefits. Using the camera aspect would enable adult learners to use digital photography in many ways, videos, talking books, on line searches for personal interests and so much more. Due to the portability of the iPad, at home and ’on the go, out and about’ other benefits include stimulating conversation regarding the use of the iPad, prompting various forms of communication for those who have difficulty verbally communicating, therefore prompting various means of communication and conversing. We will be working in partnership with COL and we will be in a position to support and create digital champions. Post training we would support new digital champions to take the iPad into various locations to share and cascade their skills, including our new project in Moray. Such locations will include schools, care homes/residential homes, care providers/organisations who support people in the community, day centres and clubs. We do require 6 iPads and protective covers to enable our learners and digital champions to learn together and from each other. The programme will take place in the social area of our premises in Nairn, the participators will be adults with learning disability age 16+ with learning disability, on the autistic spectrum and in particular adults with complex learning needs. Our focus will be on ability and promoting the innovative ways that adults can be part of and included in the digital world. Adults will have the opportunity to learn and may progress to become peer mentors/digital champions, they will take pride in sharing and/or cascading their skills at many different levels. As we are hoping to open our Moray project before the end of this year, we will be able to encourage and support our digital champions/peer mentors to cascade their skills in the new project and extended communities too.

### Planned project milestones

* why the ’i’ - working in partnership with learners, peer mentors and digital champions to create and manage their programme plan using the iPad: January 2016

* we are DIGITAL, spreading the word, updating all social media sites, produce posters to display locally and in the wider community that details achievements and invites. Interest for others to learn across the community. This will be a marketing tool and also an opportunity for a team to take their skills to our Inverness project. This will enable them to practise using their acquired skills and knowledge: February 2016

* the ’i’ way - contacting all those identified in our outreach plan and arranging to deliver training with our team of new digital champions following their confidence building exercise at the Inverness project. The team will devise a programme as a guideline for what they can cascade from their acquired skills and knowledge: March 2016


### Planned outputs and outcomes

* Adults with learning disability, on the autistic spectrum and with complex learning needs will experience inclusion in the digital world. We will be able to help them at their level of learning and appreciate everyone learns at a different pace. Our team and the trainer will have skills and patience to help adults with their recall of learning and also be able to support them to create visual guides where necessary that will have images of stages that reflect learning. This will be from switching on the iPads to accessing ’on line’ sites, downloading apps, being able to understand and use specific apps and more.

* Adults will grow in confidence, they will be the best advocates to share in which way they feel better about themselves and what they can do. This will be part of our ongoing review and evaluation. We are also conscious that there can often be a lack of appreciation for the abilities of adults with learning disability, adults on the autistic spectrum and in particular adults with complex learning needs and communication difficulties.

* Adults will be able to share their interests that they discover on line with specific learning apps and so many other useful and interesting apps that will help them socially and educationally.

* Many of our new and existing adult learners will be able to share specific skills and cascade specific skills, this will make them proud and us too, it will also ensure they are very much part of digital inclusion in our local communities.


### Lessons learned
If we were to run the project again we would do this 'in house' not through a third party.

The programme could have benefited from being delivered over a longer period of time. This is because young people with LD learn at different paces, they require patience, one to one and when revisiting previous learning covered from sessions we need to help them to learn using different strategies to help their recall.

We often had to revisit the purpose of the programme what we have covered and learned and what we will progress to learn. This was to help young people understand what we are setting out to achieve/our goals and the objectives of the project.
