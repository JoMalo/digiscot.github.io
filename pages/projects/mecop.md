### Project description

The project will be delivered from our offices on Leith Walk and will work with 60 older BME people. 40 beneficiaries will be people of Chinese origin and 20 will be of South Asian origin who will initially receive five, two-hourly training sessions covering introductory IT skills/computer awareness training. Of those, half (20 and 10 respectively) will progress to a three week advanced course to build on the skills and knowledge they have received through the course. Courses will take the following format:

Four introductory courses will be provided for Chinese people offering ten training places per course. Each course will consist of five x two hour training sessions covering the basics of IT knowledge. The tutor:beneficiary ratio for these courses will be 2:10 and tutors will be bi-lingual. Following on there will be two advanced courses, each offering ten places which will run for two hours for three weeks.

Provision for the South Asian community will follow the same format but with smaller class sizes (five places) with one tutor per class (ratio of 1:5). Due to the cultural needs of this group, single-gender classes will be on offer and will be delivered on a gender basis by bi-lingual tutors.

The project will be delivered by bilingual trainers based on the needs of two culturally and linguistically diverse communities. As a result of each groups’ specific needs, development and delivery will be based on the concept of cultural competence. As such, the project’s success will depend on the knowledge held within the organisation and by training staff, with whom we have worked before.

As previously stated; this is an innovative project and will be the only one of its kind which delivers training in to older and elderly minority ethnic people in their native tongues while at the same time considering their cultural needs. Within Edinburgh and the Lothians there are a number of organisations which work with Chinese and South Asian people but MECOPP is the only organisation in Scotland that works with older and elderly minority ethnic carers. Similarly, there are various organisations that deliver IT training to different sections of the minority ethnic community but these are aimed at other specific target groups, for example, younger South Asian people, Sikh women only, women only, etc. This project would be unique in that it would work with two culturally diverse groups of older and elderly people to provide bespoke IT skills training, delivered in the clients’ first language.

Project costs include the purchase of ten transformer books (these offer the functionality of a laptop and the practicality and mobility of a tablet) and also the purchase of ten Chinese writing tablets (these allow people to write Chinese symbols which are then uploaded to a pc/laptop/tablet).
