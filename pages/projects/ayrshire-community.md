## Project plan

### Project description

To provide a twice weekly Digital Skills Job Club aimed at those who do not have access to IT and who struggle to use a computer due to a lack of knowledge and skills. People will be supported on a one to one basis in a group setting to set up an email address, register with Universal Job Match and My World of Work, apply for ESA, PIP and other benefits and conduct
Job searches and keeps their Job Seekers Agreement and account updated in order to prevent sanctions.

In conjunction with this we wish to provide basic training on how to use Microsoft Office, particularity Word so they feel confident to create CV's and covering letters and know how to save and edit them for future use. We will also provide training on how best to use the internet in order to research employers and to save money. We will do this by employing a part time
worker (10 hrs per week) and recruiting a team of volunteers to provide the training and one to one support.

Targets for the forthcoming year are:

•	200 people will report an increase in their digital skills

•	70 people will complete a 10 week digital training programme linked to their job search

•	50 people will progress to further learning opportunities

•	40 people will take up volunteering opportunities

•	30 people will be referred / signposted to external organistions for further support such as Credit Unions or Citizens Advice

•	120 people will report and increase in their confidence, self esteem and mental wellbeing

•	People will report a decrease in benefit sanctions

•	People will report feeling more in control of their finances

## Project milestones and evaluation:

## Phase 1 - July 2015

We have now managed to recuit a Digital Skills Job Club Worker who started the post on 13th July 2015. We have started to publicise the Work Clubs, Universal Jobmatch Support Sessions and the IT Training.

## Phase 2 - July - August 2015

From 13th July to 26th August we have had 109 visits to our Work Clubs with an increasing number looking for additional support with Universal Jobmatch. We have also had 5 individuals complete the IT Training Programme.

The Digital Skills Jobclub Worker has identified areas that the attendees could benefit from, a few areas are - Energy Advice, Housing Issues, Debt and Banking. She has been working with partners throughout North Ayrshire to come in and deliver awareness raising sessions. So far sessions have been delivered from:

• North Ayrshire Citizens Advice

• Energy Advice

## Phase 3 - August - September 2015

Our Digital Skills Jobclub Worker has now recruited a couple of Volunteers to support the delivery of this project. They are supporting individuals who attend the Work Club sessions to create CV's, update their Universal Jobmatch and general job searching. They are also supporting the delivery of our IT Training Programme for individuals who are learning basic skills when using the computer.

## Phase 4 - September 2015

We are now looking to increase the awareness sessions and have started to identify other partners that could come along and speak to the attendees to provide support and advice on a wide range of topics.

We are looking at the next block of IT Training and inviting participants to attend this.

## Phase 5 - September 2015

We have now started our next block of IT Training and our Work Club Sessions are extremely successful. Pictures from some of our sessions are below:
