### Project description

The core activity is a digital skills development programme, with emphasis on job search activities, customised to suit needs of individuals with limited or no IT skills/experience and no personal computer access at home. With most vacancies advertised online and electronic applications very much the norm for jobseekers nowadays, it is critical that individuals have a certain level of IT/digital skills and experience to allow them to compete in this market. Accordingly, having evaluated a “pilot” programme run for a group of existing service users, we have devised the following programme delivered over a 5 week period, 3 x 3 hour sessions per week and 8 participants per group. We plan to run 5 of these programmes during the project lifetime. The project will be delivered by our Employment Co-ordinator. One of our Community Jobs Scotland youngsters has a desire to become involved in IT training as a future career path and, if successful with this application, we would retain him on payroll to assist in the delivery as much of the course is about one-to-one support.

Week 1: Getting Started:

* Introduction to keyboard, mouse and starting online

* Setting up email account and email basics

* Searching the internet

Week 2: Universal Jobmatch:

* Applying for jobs using email

* Registering, using and updating account; activity and application history; maintaining Job Seekers Agreement

Week 3: Job Hunting Online:

* Registering/using other Job Search websites – indeed.co.uk, s1job.com etc

* My World of Work

* North Lanarkshire’s Working

* Routes to Work South

Week 4: Microsoft Word Basics:

* Introduction to Word

* Creating, editing and saving Word documents

* CVs and covering letters

Week 5: Additional Online Benefits:

* Applying for Benefits

* Money advice online

* Other internet uses such as entertainment, research, social networking for jobs.

Added value: We realise that individuals accessing this programme are at a very basic level and understand the importance of ensuring that learning and skills gained in the “classroom” setting are maintained and reinforced through regular use outwith that environment. Accordingly, individuals can access any or all of the following options after completing the “IT Works For Me” training:

1.	A short-term work experience opportunity with us allowing the individual to use and expand the IT skills gained within a realistic work environment – work options available include stores, warehousing, reception, clerical, customer service with appropriate staff support and supervision a key component. After this activity, there will be an opportunity, if desired, to participate over a longer period on our employability skills development programme.

2.	Participating in our PC Build course where individuals learn how to build their own computer from redundant parts/components. On completion, the PC can then be taken away at no cost for domestic use.

3.	Additional job search assistance from by our Employment Co-ordinator.

### Planned project milestones

* Participants recruited and first course completed: December 2015

* First course evaluation plus recruitment and commencement of second course: January 2016

* Further 3 courses run over the period with evaluation taking place after each: May 2016

### Planned outputs and outcomes

* 40 individuals will overcome social isolation through involvement in a digital skills development programme

* 40 individuals will have the increased skills, knowledge and confidence to source and apply for jobs using online facilities

* 40 individuals will now be in a household with online access. Some may already have this but the PC Build course option provides an opportunity for those currently without IT access

* 25 individuals will further enhance their IT skills through participation in a real work environment which allows them to use and build upon these new skills

### Evaluation
Well our digital skills project 'IT Works for Me!' has now come to an end - what a whirlwind 6 months it has been.  Each course started as planned, which is always good, and each course was different, which is what happens with peronalisation and choice!  The feedback has been positive, here are a few examples:

"Great course.  Very Informative." (Colin)
"Course has been really good.  Had basic knowledge but can now use email and attachments. Lessons were good - not a rush." (Elaine)
"I enjoyed the course and got to do the things I needed to apply for jobs." (Christine)

Each course was designed to support the individual participant's needs, wants, and interests while covering basic digital skills for all.  Over the 5 courses we engaged with 40 members of the local community and helped them gain valuable skills that have enhanced their employability and social skills.  People who completed the 'IT Works for Me!' course then had the opportunity to participate in our popular PC Build course.  This allowed 25 people the chance to build their own PC and take it home with them.  A number of people then decided to volunteer with us due the positive experience they had on our course. Altogether we gained 6 ne volunteers who continue to develop their personal, social, and employability skills.


### Lessons learned
* Personalisation and choice has proven to be exceedingly popular and should be inbuilt in course design
* Employability and social digital skills are 2 distinct areas but with a large overlap in general health and wellbeing.
* The length of the course was probably a week too long for most people.  A shorter course would be more focused while still allowing for personalisation and choice.
* Project was an excellent vehicle for professional development of modern apprentice.
