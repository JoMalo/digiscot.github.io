### Project description

The project will take place in Volunteer Glasgowâ€™s training room at their city centre office, which is easily accessible by public transport from all parts of the city.

Feedback from previous classes has shown that though learners feel they have learned a lot about computing and technology, they would like to learn more about Skype, Social media, apps, shopping online, booking flights, job searching, security, managing photos and personal data. In addition we would introduce refugees/asylum seekers to online tutorials and activities that they can pursue in their own time to assist with English, citizenship and local information about Glasgow.

We will employ a sessional worker for 4 hours per week and hold a 2.5 hour class once a week, the other 1.5 hours to be used for preparation, assessments and evaluations. The project would also recruit 3 volunteer tutors to assist the sessional worker in delivery of the course and help with one to one tuition where it is required.

The classes will consist of 12 learners, attending for a period of 3 months which would give a throughput of 48 learners per year.

They would also prefer to be taught in the use of tablets, rather than laptops, as most people have access to tablets/smart phones rather than computers. The project is innovative in that it will not only improve the digital skills of disadvantaged people, but also increase their language skills and confidence, enabling them to pursue volunteer opportunities, helping them to integrate and benefit themselves and their local community.

### Planned project milestones

* Recruitment of 12 learners, 1 sessional worker and 3 volunteer tutors by 27th November 2015. Training programme to have also been developed by this date.

* The first class will begin with 12 learners: 2 December 2015

* Evaluation of first cohort and training programme, what worked and what needs to be revised, any areas of learning that participants want further explained or new areas to be explored by 4th March 2016. Recruitment of 12 new learners for 2nd cohort: March 2016

* Fourth and final class learners to be recruited by 9th September 2016

* Final Evaluation of project completed by December 2016.


### Planned outputs and outcomes

* 48 Volunteers will have started the programme, with 42 completing the course, 100% of participants will have increased their digital skills and internet awareness, by the end of one year.

* 100% of learners will have be able to use Skype, have set a social media account of their choosing( if they want), organise their photos and personal data, be able to access news and other information/entertainment sites of interest, shop online and search for jobs/training/voluntary work.

* 75% of participants in the programme will come from a refugee/asylum background, 100% will see a marked increase in their English and communication skills, with 40% having the language and confidence skills to take up volunteering in their community on a long term basis.

* Increase of confidence, self-esteem among 100% of learners, through being able to communicate with family and take part in conversations with others around subjects that because of their lack of access to the internet they were not party to.



### Project Update
We have just completed the first cohort of nine learners.
This consisted on eight asylum seekers/refugees and one indiginous learner.
Each learner has his own Android Tablet and subjects covered included Online Security, Social Media, Web search, Universal Credit, Facebook and Skype and Cloud storage.
All learners enjoyed the course and were issued with a certificate to say they had completed the twelve week programme.
The next cohort started on the 9th of March 2016.

### Lessons learned
Some language barriers were found to be more difficult than were imagined. Some basic computer terms needed to be explained before we could proceed, eg Bookmark, because learners didn't understand the traditional term, the computer term was new to them.
Also some learners found it difficult at the beginning to 'swipe' the screen. Perhaps a small piece of time practising this before starting the actual course may have built their confidence more.

### Project Update
We have just completed our second cohort of learners, where we had 10 Refugees/Asylum Seekers start the programme, with 8 people completing. The learners covered subjects such as, searching internet, cloud storage, social media and looking for volunteering opportunities.
For some of our learners, this was a completely new experience and opened their eyes to the potential and impact digital awareness could have on their life.
The learners had a good time made new friends and all completers were presented with a certificate at the end of the course.

### Project Update

We completed our third cohort of learners in December, where we had 6 learners start the programme, with 5 people completing. The learners covered similar subjects as in previous programmes, searching internet, cloud storage, social media and looking for volunteering opportunities. This time round we had a mix of older and younger people and refugee/asylum seekers and some native Glaswegians. This worked well as the refuges gained valuable local language and the Glaswegians gained a greater understanding of issues related to refugees.

We are also running a programme between January and March as we were unable to run a class over the summer, due to staff shortages and look forward to another fun filled programme.

### Project Update

We completed our final programme on the 29th March 2017, in this cohort we had 6 learners, 5 with english as a second language and one solitary scot. The programme using Google Nexus tablets  covered the same topics as previously, with the learners covering social media, online security, browsing, shopping, cloud storage, banking, device management, Skype, using bluetooth and email.
One thing we discovered was that people had very little knowledge of online security and spent a lot of time covering topics like malware, viruses, browsing safely,  spam and phising emails, this proved to be an eyeopener and they were eager to learn about this as they had been unaware that this existed.
Cloud storage was another area that people were unaware of and was a topic that was good to explore and raise awareness of.This also wenthand in hand with device management, as people easily lost files or photos and did not know where they had put them. THe learners had an enjoyable time and felt much more confident about using the internet.

Some Learners exploring new worlds.
