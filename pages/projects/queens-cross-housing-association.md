## Project plan

### Project description

Getting older people enagaged and learning how to use the internet through researching their local history.


## Project milestones

### Phase 1 January - February 2015

Recruitment of Sessional Worker  - William Harvie has joined us as out Historical Connections Worker. William is an experience member of the Community Development Team having worked with us on placement in 2013. He is passionate about Local History and has already proven to be a great asset to the team!

Purchase of Equipment: We purchased 3 iPads to supplement our existing 'mobile kit' for use in sessions. Our learners are really enjoying playing with the new equipment. Our new printers arrived recently as well, we've been scanning and printing photographs

### Phase 2 February - March 2015

Make up local history kits to be used in classes, use sample family trees, documents and photographs

Open days and events aimed at recruiting members to join the groups: We recently attended our Supported Housing Focus Day at the Science Centre and had a chance to show a wide range of tenants some of the photos and stories we have seen and heard so far. More than 35 people signed up to take part in classes as a result of this day. We have also been attending events and open days held by other parts of the organisation to promote the project.

Marketing launched


### Phase 3 March 2015

Begin sessions.

Primary focus on familiarizing members with devices, basic internet awareness, internet safety etc. We have now started four Historical Connections groups with a second wave of three new groups starting the first week in September.

Establish blog and write sample content to inspire learners, establish plan for blogging and content with Communications Team. Our blog has been created and new content is being added weekly, this will soon be ready to share.

### Phase 4 April to September 2015

Genealogical research begins – familiarize learners with the tools required and the recording possibilities

Encourage some brief blogs about experience of using the internet to research family history

Start to collect photographs and videos to create history map and blogposts.

Liaise with Youth Work Coordinator re working within the Youth Clubs, look at ways in which the Young People and Older People might work together

Establish a project plan for working with Young People in Youth Clubs and begin work with them

### Phase 5 September 2015 to January 2016

Encourage learners to interview each other about their research and experiences, record this and upload to blog

Encourage learners to share their stories and findings via the blog

Bring together Older and Younger learners

### Phase 6 December 2015 to January 2016

Devise action plan to seek further funding to make project sustainable for the longer term

Recruit Digital Ambassadors from groups for further training to then support the groups digitally

## Evaluation

### Overall this project

Worked to engage older people with the internet by harnessing their interest in social history and genealogy. We sought to create small groups of people with a shared interest in history and offer them basic computing skills classes as well as specific sessions based on online geneology research.

We created a blog and had some success at asking group members to contribute to posts about their research and experiences, though they were less enthusiastic about this aspect.

The tenants particularly enjoyed learning how to watch videos online and find old photographs of Glasgow using the Mitchell Library’s online resources. A small group of tenants managed to trace their family history back to the 1700s while a larger group explored their families’ more recent history.

We established six weekly sessions for our older tenants and supported a weekly youth club at Woodside Library with local history activities.

Offer a cross-generational experience for young people engaged in our Youth Projects, we worked with them to discuss questions of local identity, the history of the streets that they live and play in and life in the time of their grandparents. We took them on a day trip to the seaside and experienced a day out in Millport like their parents might have and we also visited Summerlee Heritage Museum and created activities and scavenger hunts about history.

### Long-term sustained engagement

*	72 Young People in total, with an average of 35 on a weekly basis for a 6 month period.
*	Establish six drop-in sessions in our community rooms and Sheltered Housing complexes.
*	80 adult tenants were regularly attending these drop in sessions with a weekly average of 52 attendees.

### One-off engagement

*	Supported Housing Focus Day saw the project speak to 140 tenants about the photo archive, local history and their memories.
*	The 2015 Gala Day stall was very popular and saw more than 300 visitors engage with the project and the photo archive.

### Outcomes for the people and the groups we care about:

*	Attendees of the groups left with improved computing skills, many had started to use the UK Online Centres Learn my Way resources and others had purchased/been given their own tablets and were comfortable using them.
*	We know this because we have continued to work with some of the groups, refer others onto our other services and provide Digital Inclusion support generally. We administer the Learn My Way course and so can see learner engagement with the programme.
*	We took the move to install WiFi in the communal areas of all Sheltered Housing Complexes so that our learners could continue to use the internet when the project came to an end.
*	We have started to provide monthly digital inclusion drop-in sessions in 5 of the venues, and learners continue to support one another and meet up out-with the sessions.
*	We held open days in the Sheltered Housing Complexes to promote services and demonstrate the new WiFi. At these eventsaA majority of learners expressed an increase in their personal confidence at using the internet and digital devices following their engagement with Historical Connections.
*	One group of ten learners are now working towards their Computer Online Basics qualification from the City and Guilds.
*	We have established a Youth Volunteering Project to build on the cross-generational work done within the project. This programme will see Young People trained as Digital Ambassadors and then they will come to drop-in sessions to help support learners.
*	Queens Cross has decided to build on the work done with Historical Connections to celebrate their 40th Anniversary. They are collecting our tenants stories and memories to create a living archive for our learners and tenants to enjoy and share.
*	We have a tablet library of 10 iPads, 3 of which were purchased with funds from Historical Connections, that can be used

## Lessons learned

### Things that worked well:

1.	History Trips with Young People: these were really popular and the Young People enjoyed learning about the lived history of their area and traditional activities/holidays.
2.	Making family trees: this aspect proved really popular and those tenants that were interested in researching their families loved this aspect.
3.	Setting up groups and letting them guide their own learning worked best, they became really good support for one another and a lot of issues surrounding loneliness and health and wellbeing came up as a result of these sessions.

### Things that we would do differently next time:

1.	Pop up events in coffee shops. This would have helped raise awareness of the project and increase interest in the sessions. People would have then found out about events and sessions on their own territory and this might have brought them into other venues.
2.	Make Sheltered Housing sessions open to all and combine sessions. Not all of our older tenants are in Sheltered accommodation and it would have been good to combine groups and have Sheltered and Non-Sheltered tenants in sessions together.
3.	More cross-generational work, podcasting etc. It would also have been good to cook meals together with the older people to break down barriers further. This would have meant that when we tried to go on trips there was less suspicion from both sides.
