## Project plan

### Project description

To support volunteer & mentor workshops introducing the social media tool LinkedIn, and other social media platforms, as a tool for networking and effective job searching. Workshops will be provided physically and online, making use of digital conferencing technology.


## Project milestones

### Software Development: Completed

Have identified Webex software to use to deliver webinars and are currently working with the company and our LinkedIn trainer [Jackie Cameron](http://www.consultcameron.com/) to develop her exisiting LinkedIn workshop for webinar format.

We have had to change software providers due to initial communication problems, and delivery issues, however now we are confident with the provider and have completed the 'induction' process. We will continue to use the software platform - Webex - going forward.

### Delivery: Workshop 1, February 2015

1st LinkedIn workshop delivered at [Let's Get Sporty](http://letsgetsporty.com/) in Dumfries

8 of our volunteers in Dumfries and the surrounding area attended this workshop.  All who attended felt they learned something new and valuable with 100% reporting that they have a greater understanding of how to present their personal qualities to employers and others.

"Today made me notice that there is a lot of different choices towards finding a job."
"Interested me in the possibilities and opportunities that using social media correctly can hold."

### Delivery: Workshop 2, April 2015

2nd LinkedIn workshop took place in Glasgow hosted by [PwC](http://www.pwc.co.uk/)

11 volunteers attended this workshop, 60% of whom had little or no experience of using LinkedIn prior to the workshop.  100% of participants felt they had 'lots' of knowledge post workshop and all told us they would continue to use LinkedIn to help with job searching and networking.

"Just thanks for an interesting afternoon - it's encouraging to see successful people helping the younger generation out, and greatly appreciated."
"Really enjoyed [Jackie Cameron](http://www.consultcameron.com/)'s workshop - her information was presented passionately and will help me when job hunting."
"It was positive and we were given personal and valuable advice."

### Delivery: Webinar Development, throughout 2015

1st Webinar to be delivered in Edinburgh at ProjectScotland office.  Having adapted the existing LinkedIn workshops, the webinar will run for c. 40 minutes and be delivered to a maximum of 10 young people (remote) to enable us to test the delivery and engagement of participants, to trouble-shoot problems. Development of the software and practical considerations took place throughout the latter half of 2015 with the first webinar aiming for delivery beginning of 2016

Post webinar, we will reveiew with the trainer and note any changes to make for subsequent webinars.  We will collect feedback from volunteers.  Pending any significant changes being required to delivery this webinar will then be made available to current and past ProjectScotland volunteers.

### Delivery: Workshop 3, 8th October 2015 - Dundee

This workshop took place in the Prince's Trust offices in Dundee on 8th October. We secured 16 sign ups (target attendance of 15) however on the day attendance was low, at 3. This was really disappointing given the efforts put into organising. Within Dundee the young people we work with are further from work, and have multiple barriers and chaotic circumstances surrounding their current situation. This can affect attendance to both their voluntary placements and the development opportunities.

Saying that, all attendees found that the workshop was relevant to their individual goals and that the content was well delivered. They also all agreed that they now better understood the qualities that employers were looking for and have greater understanding about how Linkedin can help them do that. We are learning that Linkedin has not been a tool that young people either engage with, or understand, in terms of how it can affect future employment. The volunteers attending this workshop certainly echoed that and left feeling that they now knew how best to engage with Linkedin, and use the tool for their own journey.

### Delivery: Workshop 4, 21st October 2015

LinkedIn workshop in Glasgow hosted by PWC (8 attended)

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en-gb"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There&#39;s still time to sign up for our latest workshop! Why not harness the power of social media and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GetOnInLife?src=hash">#GetOnInLife</a>? <a href="http://t.co/pp2MJWblZd">http://t.co/pp2MJWblZd</a></p>&mdash; ProjectScotland (@ProjectScotland) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectScotland/status/656098277364994049">October 19, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

"One of the real successes was that at the start the participants were asked what they wanted to get from the workshop. This provided clear objectives for the session that were tailored to our needs. The trainer (Jackie) was then able to focus on the issues that were important to us. Jackie was incredibly knowledgeable on how to create a fantastic  LinkedIn profiles and also ways to link this with other social media platforms. She also encouraged us to “connect” with her if we had any questions in the future." Phil Stephenson, ProjectScotland volunteer and attendee

After this workshop we have noticed a need to tweak the content so that it is continually refreshed and encompasses our learnings of Linkedin workshops thus far.

### Delivery: Workshop 5, 1st pilot webinar, 21 January 2016

Key Learnings with regards to delivery:
1. Quite technical to deliver a webinar therefore we have encouraged our trainer to research and watch more webinars to develop the techniques in time for the next webinar
2. The platform doesn't allow participants to engage with each other and thus see any questions that participants may have asked. It would be useful if all participants could engage in the 'chat' tool during the webinar and allow all to see feedback
3. Turnout was far better than workshops in person. 11 confirmed, 10 attended. This shows that for the young people we work with webinars are definitely the preferred option


### Delivery: Workshop 6, 23rd February 2016

Social Media and Job Hunting  - Creating your own success; hosted by our charity partners Young Enterprise Scotland, Glasgow

9 young people signed up to this workshop but only 5 attended. This cements our learnings that whilst young people are keen to develop their online skills, sometimes the barriers to attendance prevent this. All attendees stated that they learnt something news with comments such as 'I learnt how to present myself better on Linkedin for job opportunities' and 'The importance of Linkedin in finding new jobs.' And our trainer, Jackie Cameron, was even described as fabulous!

100% agreed that the content was relevant to their goal of finding employment
80% of attendees stated that they had improved their skills in applying for jobs/development opportunities
And all attendees agreed that the content was well delivered and useful.

### Mentor Workshop 1: March 15th - Edinburgh
This was our first workshop aimed at mentors which was extremely well received - 5 attended but because this was 'in person' we expected our numbers to be down. The next 2 workshops were webinars which fits in more with the various locations of our mentors (not all are in 1 centralised town/city). Our Mentors are crucial to the volunteering experience supporting young people to reflect on what they are learning and using this to prepare for a work environment. The support of the Digital Challenge Fund has enabled us to give them more resources on how to use Social Media to increase employability skills. This will ensure that Mentors are equipped with the knowledge to focus and advise their volunteers, and also develop their own knowledge.

All felt that the inclusion of twitter as a platform to job search was really interesting; but also they learnt more about how to present their own skills and experience on this platform as well. All felt that the content was relevant to the support they need to give their volunteers and 100% felt that they came away with valuable learnings.

### Linkedin Workshop (Volunteer workshop 7) Edinburgh - 16th March
7 young people signed up but only 5 attended.100% of attendees agreed that the content was well delivered and valuable in their goal of getting on in life. 100% agreed that the workshop had improved their skills in job hunting (eg by using Linkedin more effectively) and 80% stated that they better understood what employers might be looking for on their various social media profiles.

### Mentor Workshop 2: April 2016 - 1st webinar

Attended by 5 mentors. All had previous knowledge of Linkedin which is different from the knowledge that the young people we support have - these young people tend to me more engaged with Facebook, Instagram & Snapchat.

All mentors agreed that using technology is vital in their mentoring relationship.And after the training session all agreed that they would be more confident in using Linkedin to support their volunteers' job search.

### Volunteer Workshop 8 - April 2016
8 signed up but only 3 attended. Again when dealing with young people, many of whom come from chaotic backgrounds, attendance is a challenge.
: all agreed that the workshop content was relevant to their goal of getting a job
: all agreed that the content was well delivered
: and all agreed that they learnt something valuable

The most useful things that the young people stated that they had learnt was the use of Twitter & Linkedin in terms of their job searching.

### Volunteer Social Media Workshop 9 - 24th May - Edinburgh
Only 4 people signed on for this webinar - again evidencing the challenge of young people engaging. This was already moved back from a previous date as we hadn't had enough interest. However everybody who attended agreed the following
: they better understood the skills employers/educational institutions were looking for
: they better understood how to present their personal qualities to employers (50% strongly agreed/50% agreed)
: and all agreed that they had better improved their skills in applying for jobs

Some of the most useful things that the young people learnt was how to actually showcase themselves effectively using Linkedin and 1 attendee commented that it was "a great workshop; very interactive & well delivered"


### Mentor Workshop 3: 13th June
17 mentors signed up to this workshop and 13 attended.

All agreed that the content was relevant to their role as a mentor and that they learnt something valuable in terms of being able to offer further support in their mentoring relationship. Interestingly the mentors came to the workshop with a better understanding of different platforms - whilst all felt they needed to learn more about Linkedin; their knowledge set tended to be limited to Twitter and Facebook. Again a sign of the differing platforms that our mentors are familiar with vs the platforms that young people engage with (eg Snapchat, What'sApp)

Some feedback that we had was that attendees would have found it useful to see other questions submitted during the feedback session - this is development that we will be working on for the next series of webinars.

### Last Workshop for Volunteers (10) - 16th June.
This workshop was attended by XX volunteers including some from our Dumfries Academy project. Once again involved ProjectScotland staff in supporting the delivery of the training and ensuring the tone was suitable for our young people to engage with.
Awaiting specific feedback. See photo supplied directly to SCVO.

### Webinar & Website development: Completed

This has now been completed - a permanent online resource to be accessed by all ProjectScotland volunteers and other young people.
Please visit our page [What Next?] (https://www.projectscotland.co.uk/volunteers/what-next/)

Total views since created at end of March (figures up to end of May) – 341
221 of those are “unique” views so 120 have accessed the page more than once/returned to view more content
Bounce rate is only 32 % (the norm is 65%-85%) this means once people access the page they stay on it for some time
17% exit rate (again this is much lower than the norm which is well over 40%) it means people that land on this page rarely leave our website directly from here - shows the content is promising
268 of those views are in the first fortnight


## Evaluation

We have learnt a phenomenal amount internally about the importance of these workshops and the challenges that our mentors and young face in a digital context; but also our staff have learnt an enormous amount about how to use the software and increase their own learnings. Going forward we will be continuing to use this technology, particularly for our mentors where it was extremely well received.

### Outputs and outcomes

Overall this project has supported 23 mentors, 10 ProjectScotland staff to enhance their learning, and supported 57 young people to learn more about the social platforms that can help them get on in life. Overwhelmingly every single workshop was met with 100% approval in terms of content delivery, and usefulness in terms of the support it gave both volunteers and mentors.

In terms of outputs we delivered 3 workshops aimed at our mentors, development of a central resources section on our website that means young people have more tools at their disposal and 10 workshops for our volunteers.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has improved the employment prospects of our young people, improved the potential of inter-generational relationships through mentoring & volunteering by enhancing the mentors knowledge of social platforms, and increased the young people's confidence in engaging with employers. We know this because of the continuing feedback we have secured.

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. The premise of delivering webinars instead of workshops in 1 fixed location.
2. Once staff learnt about delivery then the process of delivery was quite easy - we brought in our internal Marketing Manager to support the trainer as well
3. Engagement with mentors has been a stand out element of this project. They have really benefitted from this training and feel more able to engage & support the young people they work with.
4. As previously mentioned we brought in our Marketing Manager (a previous ProjectScotland volunteer) who was able to add in her knowledge alongside the trainer. This meant that the tone was kept in line with what young people need and could relate to, and didn't become too formal/professional.

Things that we would do differently next time:

1. Promotion - at the moment we are too reliant on twitter and email. And these elements aren't attracting the volume of numbers we hoped. In the future we would envisage doing more face to face/telephone chasing as well as pulling in more marketing support.
2. Use internal staff more to deliver these workshops as we know have the knowledge and means to be able to facilitate this.
3. Ensure we are constantly re-evaluating the content, and sign up process. We had problems with not only attracting sign ups but also attendance once sign up was confirmed. A large part of this is to do with the demographic of young people that we are supporting and it would probably be impossible to secure a 100% attendance rate.
