## Project plan

### Project description

Moray Firth Media Trust will be working with prisoners at Inverness Prison. We are running six part time courses in digital audio and radio broadcasting production. In addition to improving confidence, motivation and core vocational skills, participants will learn basic digital skills and with the use of digital equipment such as portable recorders, Adobe Audition and other software, will learn how to digitally edit the sounds and to build their own show to a specific time frame. A certificate will be gained on completion of the course.

Radioskills Summer School - This project is being made available for up to 12 participants, over 16 years of age and to anyone with an interest or aspiration to learn new digital skills. Radioskills Summer School candidates will learn how to create entertaining digital content that will connect and engage with audiences both at home and abroad. They will learn how to write and plan a digital radio programme as well as how to use industry standard digital recording and editing equipment.
It is likely that with the participants permission we would be able to showcase their broadcast on our Inverness based trainees radio station, Monster FM,  in September.


## Project milestones
The course is running really well in Inverness Prison with 10 participants regulalrly taking part in the weekly digital media sessions. They have been creating features for the production of their own show and producing the voice links which will then need to be digitally edited in the weeks ahead. Due to the nature of the prison and the varying length of stays it was decided to run the course on a rolling basis for 36 weeks allowing any number of participants, up to a maximum of 10 per week, to take part. It is expected that over a 36 week period we will have seen more than 36 trainees for an average of 8 weeks each. They are using portable digital recorders and managing digital media files on the computer systems, digital editing software and enhancing skills previously learnt.

Summer School is in full flow and the trainees are busy working hard putting together their own shows to be showcased on Monster FM in September. They have had lectures on radio presenting, practicals on digital desk driving, portable digital recorders and the transfer of data. They have been planning digital content, writing and interviewing and then digitally editing using the relevant software and entering the voice links for their music. All of this digital content is being planned to a precise show time schedule. The plan had originally been for them to record an hour long show but it seems they're all keen and may each be able to produce up to 4 hours of show.

## Evaluation

### **Inverness Prison Project**

### Overview

Our aim was to provide ongoing weekly digital skills training to inmates at Inverness Prison to teach digital skills that could assist them with securing employment upon their release and create an interesting, creative and beneficial educational opportunity during their incarceration

### Outputs and outcomes

In terms of outputs we delivered digital skills training in a few different forms:
The participants were required to use MS Office for writing and planning their shows and interviews using laptops.

Attendees were shown how to record audio for interviews using portable digital recorders and microphones. These recorders were left available to the inmates during the week in order for them to continue recording material for their shows and features.

They were also taught how to upload the audio to computers and how to edit the audio using the editing computer software Adobe Audition on the laptops.

In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has exceeded all our expectations. We know this because we have had very positive feedback from the prison. The Head of Offender Outcomes at the prison, Peter Rawlinson, said, ’HMP Inverness is constantly looking for new and inventive ways to engage prisoners in purposeful activity. We are aiming to promote citizenship, develop learning and employability skills and motivate those in our care to transform their lives and become responsible members of society. This project, run in partnership with colleagues from Fife College, Highland CJSW and tutors from Radioskills (Moray Firth Media Trust) has been enormously successful in developing communication skills, self-confidence and computing ability amongst the group of prisoners involved.’

The feeling amongst the participants themselves is also positive with feedback ranging from finding it an interesting course and enjoying doing ‘something constructive’ to learning the value of
team work and communication and the experience resulting in ‘not being so nervous in groups anymore.’

We had hoped to use the shows produced by the inmates for broadcast on our RSL Monster FM however we were informed by the prison months into the course that unfortunately these shows could only be broadcast within the prison itself. This was extremely disappointing as a lot of the material produced by the prisoners was exceptionally professional sounding and emotive

### Lessons learned

Things that worked well:

1. Setting weekly deadlines for completion of tasks worked well to keep the training moving at a good pace.
2. Asking inmates to carry out tasks between Tuesdays kept them occupied and motivated to attend the following week.


### **Summer School**

### Overview

Our aim was to provide intensive digital training to school leavers and those in between college/university courses during the summer holidays. We hoped this would enable those who were unable to attend courses during the day at other times of the year to gain much-needed digital skills.

### Outputs and Outcomes

In terms of outputs we delivered digital training to five course participants over five days. This was followed on by the opportunity to use the studio equipment the following week under supervision. They learned various digital skills including learning to drive a working radio desk involving use of Dalet – a digital play-out system responsible for playing all the music, jingles, promos and features required during a radio broadcast.

The participants were required to use MS Office for writing and planning their shows and interviews using laptops.

Attendees were shown how to record audio for interviews using portable digital recorders and microphones.

They were also taught how to upload the audio to computers and how to edit the audio using the editing computer software Adobe Audition on the laptops.

This project provided the participants with a varied range of digital skills which can be taken on to many different areas of their personal, academic and working lives. We know this has been incredibly successful because they were able to independently create their own completed recorded radio shows using their new digital skills which are currently airing on Monster FM 106.1.

### Lessons Learned

Things that worked well:

1. The intensive training and practise period of five days followed by a week recording shows helped the participants retain the skills they learned.
2. The incentive of recording their own shows using their new skills during the second week was motivating.
